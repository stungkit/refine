Refine allows you to use all the features of [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) with `@refinedev/react-table` adapter. In this way, you can manage your server-side data operations. By using this adapter, you can directly use all the features of React Table in your Refine project. For more information, you can view the live example or review the source code to see how it's used with Chakra UI.

[Refer to the React Table documentation for more information. →](/core/docs/packages/list-of-packages)
