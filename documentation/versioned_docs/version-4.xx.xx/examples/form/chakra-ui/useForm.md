Refine allows you to use all the features of [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library with `@refinedev/react-hook-form` adapter. Using this package, you can create your own **headless** forms and use all the features provided by React Hook Form in your Refine project in a compatible way. You can view the live example or review the source code to see how it's used with Chakra UI.
