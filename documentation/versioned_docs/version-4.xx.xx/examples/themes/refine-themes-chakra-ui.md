You can use predefined themes provided by Refine. In this example, we have created an example application by using the [`RefineThemes`](/core/docs/ui-integrations/chakra-ui/theming#predefined-themes) from `@refinedev/chakra-ui`. You can easily [customize your theme](/core/docs/ui-integrations/chakra-ui/theming#overriding-the-themes) as you wish in your Refine project.
