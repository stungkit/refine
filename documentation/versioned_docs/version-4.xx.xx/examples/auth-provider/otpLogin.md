A one-time password(OTP) is a password that has two fundamental properties : it expires quickly, and it can’t be reused. OTPs are usually numeric or alphanumeric strings and are generated for a single login procedure. This example shows how to utilize OTP input logic with Refine. You can use one-time passwords to access your application with Refine [AuthProvider](/core/docs/authentication/auth-provider).
