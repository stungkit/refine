This guide is a comprehensive, seven-part tutorial that walks you through building two full-stack apps with [**Refine**](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) and [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/). By the end, you'll have a fully functional CRUD app called "**Pixels**" and an admin dashboard called "**Pixels Admin**".

[The live version of the app is available here.](https://pixels.refine.dev/)

The final apps source codes are available on GitHub:

### Pixels Client

[Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels)

To get completed client source code simply run:

```

## Part 1: Pilot & Refine Architecture

## What is **Refine** ?

**Refine** is a highly customizable **React** based framework for building CRUD apps that comes with a headless core package and supplementary "pick-and-plug" modules for the UI, backend API clients and Internationalization support.

**Refine**'s (intentionally decapitalized) core is strongly opinionated about RESTful conventions, HTTPS networking, state management, authentication and authorization. It is, however, unopinionated about the UI and render logic. This makes it customizable according to one's choice of UI library and frameworks.

In a nutshell, you can build rock-solid CRUD apps easily using Refine✨.

## Refine Architecture

Everything in **Refine** is centered around the [`<Refine />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/) component, which is configured via a set of provider props that each requires a provider object to be passed in. A typical application of providers on the `<Refine />` component looks like this:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import dataProvider from "@refinedev/simple-rest";
import routerProvider from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { liveProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";
import authProvider from "./authProvider";

<Refine
    dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
    routerProvider={routerProvider}
    liveProvider={liveProvider(supabaseClient)}
    authProvider={authProvider}
    resources={[]}
    ...
/>;
```

The above snippet lists a few of the props and their objects.

However, rather than precisely being a component, `<Refine />` is largely a monolith of provider configurations backed by a context for each. Hence, inside [`dataProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/), we have a standard set of methods for making API requests; inside [`authProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/auth-provider/), we have methods for dealing with authentication and authorization; inside [`routerProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/), we have _exact_ definitions of routes and the components to render for that route, etc. And each provider comes with its own set of conventions and type definitions.

For example, a `dataProvider` object has the following signature to which any definition of a data provider conform:

<details>
<summary>Show data provider code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="dataProvider.ts"
const dataProvider = {
  create: ({ resource, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  createMany: ({ resource, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  deleteOne: ({ resource, id, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  deleteMany: ({ resource, ids, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  //highlight-start
  getList: ({ resource, pagination, pagination, sort, filters, meta }) =>
    Promise,
  //highlight-end
  getMany: ({ resource, ids, meta }) => Promise,
  getOne: ({ resource, id, meta }) => Promise,
  update: ({ resource, id, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  updateMany: ({ resource, ids, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  custom: ({ url, method, sort, filters, payload, query, headers, meta }) =>
    Promise,
  getApiUrl: () => "",
};
```

</p>
</details>

The underlying architecture involves any presentational component passed to `<Refine />` to be able to consume these configured methods via corresponding hooks. Each method in a provider has a corresponding hook via which a consumer component is able to fetch data from the backend, i.e. the [`useList()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/hooks/use-list/) hook is the corresponding function accessing the `dataProvider.getList()` provider method.

An example hook usage looks like this:

```tsx title="Inside a UI component"
const { result } = useList<Canvas>({
  resource: "canvases",
  pagination: {
    mode: "off",
  },
  sorters: {
    initial: [
      {
        field: "created_at",
        order: "desc",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

The hooks, in turn, leverage [**React Query**](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) hooks in order to make API calls asked by the provider methods. Here's an early sneak peek into the action under the hood:

<details>
<summary>Show Refine `useList` hook code</summary>
<p>

```tsx
const queryResponse = useQuery<GetListResponse<TData>, TError>(
  queryKey.list(config),
  ({ queryKey, pagination, signal }) => {
    const { pagination, meta, ...restConfig } = config || {};
    return getList<TData>({
      resource,
      ...restConfig,
      pagination,
      meta: {
        ...meta,
        queryContext: {
          queryKey,
          pageParam,
          signal,
        },
      },
    });
  },
  {
    ...queryOptions,
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      queryOptions?.onSuccess?.(data);

      const notificationConfig =
        typeof successNotification === "function"
          ? successNotification(data, { meta, config }, resource)
          : successNotification;

      handleNotification(notificationConfig);
    },
    onError: (err: TError) => {
      checkError(err);
      queryOptions?.onError?.(err);

      const notificationConfig =
        typeof errorNotification === "function"
          ? errorNotification(err, { meta, config }, resource)
          : errorNotification;

      handleNotification(notificationConfig, {
        key: `${resource}-useList-notification`,
        message: translate(
          "common:notifications.error",
          { statusCode: err.statusCode },
          `Error (status code: ${err.statusCode})`,
        ),
        description: err.message,
        type: "error",
      });
    },
  },
);
```

</p>
</details>

We'll be visiting code like this often, but if you examine closely you can see that **Refine** uses **React Query** to handle caching, state management as well as errors out-of-the-box.

The following diagram illustrates the interactions:

<br />

## Providers and Hooks

**Refine**'s power lies in the abstraction of various app component logic such as authentication, authorization, routing and data fetching - inside individual providers and their corresponding hooks.

Common providers include:

- [`authProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/auth-provider/) - for authentication and authorization.
- [`dataProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/) - for CRUD operations.
- [`routerProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/) - for defining routes, RESTful and non-RESTful.
- [`liveProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/) - for implementing real time features.
- [`accessControlProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/accessControl-provider/) - for access control management.
- [`auditLogProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/audit-log-provider/) - for logging appwide activities.

For an exhaustive list of providers, please visit the **Refine** providers documentation from [here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/).

Each method in these providers comes with its corresponding hook to be used from inside UI components and pages. For more details, please refer to the **Refine** hooks documentation starting [here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/accessControl/useCan/).

## Support Packages

**Refine** is inherently headless in its core API and deliberately agnostic about the UI and backend layers. Being so, it is able to provide fantastic support for major UI libraries and frameworks as well as popular backend frameworks and services. To name a few, **Refine**'s UI support packages include [**Ant Design**](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/), [**Material UI**](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/mui/), [**Chakra UI**](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/chakra-ui/) and [**Mantine**](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/mantine/). Backend supplementary modules include [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/), [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/), and [**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/)

For a complete list of all these modules, check out [this page](/core/docs/packages/list-of-packages/).

## What is Supabase?

[**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) is an open source alternative to Firebase. It is a hosted backend that provides a realtime database, authentication, storage, and API services.

Refine has a built-in data provider support for Supabase. You can find the advanced tutorial [here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/packages/documentation/data-providers/supabase/).

We'll be using **Supabase** to build our backend for **Pixels** app.

## A week of Refine ft. Supabase

  <img  src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-04-refine-pixels-1/pixel-logo-background.png" alt="Pixels app logo banner" />

  <br/>
  <br/>

In this tutorial series, we will be going through most of the core features of [**Refine**](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) by building two apps related to drawing pixels on a canvas. This section is intended to provide an overview.

The first one, the client app - **Pixels**, allows a logged in user to create a canvas and draw on it together with other users. It also displays a public gallery of all canvases and a "Featured Canvases" page.

The second app, **Pixels Admin** is an admin dashboard that allows authorized users like `editor`s and `admin`s to view the list of users registered with **Pixels** app and manage user drawn canvases, with actions like promoting, unpromoting and deleting a canvas.

We will be building these two apps day-by-day over a period of 7 days. And while doing so, we will dive deep into the details of related providers, hooks, UI components and how **Refine** works behind the scenes.

As far as our features and functionalities go, we will cover most of the providers and some of the related hooks. For the UI side, we will be using the optional [**Ant Design**](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/) package supported by **Refine**. For the backend, we will use a PostgreSQL database hosted on the [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) cloud.

<br />

Here are the detailed outlines split per day:

### Day One - On RefineWeek

This post. Hello! :wave: :wave: **Refine** welcomes you! We are here :smile: :smile:

### Day Two - Setting Up the Client App

We start with setting up the **Pixels** client app using `create refine-app`. We choose **Refine**'s optional **Ant Design** and **Supabase** modules as our support packages. After initialization, we explore the boilerplate code created by `create refine-app` and look into the details of the `dataProvider` and `authProvider` objects and briefly discuss their mechanisms.

### Day Three - Adding CRUD Actions & Authentication

On Day Three, we start adding features to our app. We activate the `resources` prop for `<Refine />` and using the `dataProvider` prop, we implement how to create a canvas, show a canvas and draw pixels on a canvas. We add a public gallery to show all canvases in a page and featured canvases in another. We also implement user authentication so that only signed in users can create and draw on a canvas - and while doing so we delve into the `authProvider` object.

Here is a quick sum up of specifications we cover on Day Three:

1. The **Pixels** app has a public gallery.
2. The public gallery has a home page of featured canvases.
3. The public gallery contains a section for all the canvases.
4. All users can view the public gallery.
5. All users can view a canvas.
6. Only logged in users can create a canvas.
7. Only logged in users can draw pixels on a canvas.
8. A user can sign up to the app using email, Google and GitHub.
9. A user can log in to the app using email, Google and GitHub.

### Day Four - Adding Realtime Collaboration

On Day Four, we add **real time** features to our app using the `liveProvider` prop on `<Refine />`. Real time updates on a canvas will facilitate multiple users to collaborate on it at the same time.

We are going to use **Supabase**'s **Realtime** [PostgreSQL CDC](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-cdc) in order to perform row level updates on the PostgreSQL database in real time.

### Day Five - Initialize and Build Pixels Admin App

Basing on the learning from the client app, we quickly implement an admin dashboard app and explore how **Refine**'s **Ant Design** support module is geared to rapidly build CRUD pages for a **Refine** app.

Here are the requirements for **Pixels Admin**:

1. Allow a user to sign up to the app using email, Google and GitHub.
2. Allow a user to log in to the app using email, Google and GitHub.
3. Build a dashboard that lists `users` and `canvases`.
4. The dashboard shows a list of all users at `/users` endpoint.
5. The dashboard shows a list of all canvases at `/canvases` endpoint.

### Day Six - Add Role Based Authorization

On Day Six, we implement user role based authorization to our admin app. While doing so, we analyze the `authProvider.getPermissions()` method from the standpoint of implementing authorization and customize according to our needs. We use **Casbin** for implementing a Role Based Access Control model and use it to define the `can` method of the `accessControlProvider` provider.

Here are the features we implement on Day Six:

1. There are two authorized roles for admin dashboard: `editor` and `admin`.
2. An editor is able to promote a canvas to "featured" status and demote it back.
3. An admin is able to promote a canvas to "featured" status and demote it back.
4. An admin is able to delete a canvas.

### Day Seven - Add Audit Log to Client App and Admin App

On the last day, with the `auditLogProvider` prop, we implement a log of all pixel drawing activities.Mutations for drawing pixels will be logged and saved in a `logs` table in our **Supabase** database.

We will display these logs inside a modal for each canvas both in the client **Pixels** app and in the **Pixels Admin** dashboard app. So, we will implement audit logging on both our apps.

## Summary

In this post, we introduced the **Refine** framework and the [RefineWeek](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine/) series itself. We talked about **Refine**'s underlying architecture which consists of providers, hooks and components that help rapidly build internal tools.

We laid out the plans for building a **Pixels** client app and an admin dashboard app in considerable depth.

---

## Part 2: Setting Up the Client App

In this episode, we initialize our **Pixels** app using [**Refine**](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) and get familiar with the boilerplate code to be created with the `create refine-app` CLI tool.

This is Day 2 of the [**RefineWeek**](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine-supabase/) series. **RefineWeek** is a seven-part tutorial that aims to help developers learn the ins-and-outs of **Refine**'s powerful capabilities and get going with **Refine** within a week.

## Overview

In the previous post, we got a preview of **Refine**'s underlying architecture, especially on how **Refine**'s core modules abstract and divide an app's logic inside individual providers and allow their methods to be easily accessed and executed with hooks from inside consumer components. This abstraction at the providers layer is where **Refine** shines and require extensive configuration to begin with.

In this part, we will get into the details of two important providers: namely, the [`dataProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/data-provider) and [`authProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authentication/auth-provider/) props of our [`<Refine />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/) component. We will be building on this knowledge in the coming episodes.

The providers will be generated by the `create refine-app` CLI tool based on our choice, so we'll start off with setting up the **Pixels** app right away.

## Project Setup

For this project, we are using a PostgreSQL database hosted in the [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) cloud. **Refine** comes with an optional package for **Supabase** that gives us `dataProvider` and `authProvider`s out-of-the-box for handling requests for CRUD actions, authentication and authorization against models hosted in a **Supabase** server.

We are going to include **Refine**'s Ant Design package for the UI side.

Let's go ahead and use the `create refine-app` CLI tool to interactively initialize the project. Navigate to a folder of your choice and run:

```bash
npm create refine-app@latest pixels
```

`create refine-app` presents us with a set of questions for choosing the libraries and frameworks we want to work with.

So, I chose the following options:

```bash
✔ Choose a project template · Refine(Vite)
✔ What would you like to name your project?: · pixels
✔ Choose your backend service to connect: · Supabase
✔ Do you want to use a UI Framework?: · Ant Design
✔ Do you want to add example pages?: · no
✔ Do you need i18n (Internationalization) support?: · no
✔ Choose a package manager: · npm
```

This should create a rudimentary **Refine** app that supports [**Ant Design**](https://ant.design/) in the UI and [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) in the backend. If we open the app in our code editor, we can see that **Refine**'s optional packages for **Ant Design** and **Supabase** are added to `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
"dependencies": {
  "@refinedev/antd": "^5.7.0",
  "@refinedev/core": "^4.5.8",
  "@refinedev/react-router-v6": "^4.1.0",
  "@refinedev/supabase": "^5.0.0",
}
```

We are going to use **Ant Design** components for our UI thanks to the `@refinedev/antd` module. `@refinedev/supabase` module allows us to use **Refine**'s **Supabase** auth and data providers.

We'll cover these **Supabase** related providers as we add features to our app in the upcoming episodes. However, let's try building the app for now, and check what we have in the browser after running the development server. In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After that, navigate to `http://localhost:5173`, and lo and behold! we have a **Refine** app:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/welcome.jpg"  alt="Pixels app welcome screen" />

<br />

## Exploring the App

Let's now see what **Refine** scaffolded for us during initialization.

Our main point of focus is the `src` folder. And for now, especially the `<App />` component.

If we look inside the `App.tsx` file, we can see a `<Refine />` component crowded with passed in **props**:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { GitHubBanner, Refine, WelcomePage } from "@refinedev/core";
import { RefineKbar, RefineKbarProvider } from "@refinedev/kbar";

import { useNotificationProvider } from "@refinedev/antd";
import "@refinedev/antd/dist/reset.css";

import routerProvider, {
  DocumentTitleHandler,
  UnsavedChangesNotifier,
} from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { dataProvider, liveProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import authProvider from "./authProvider";
import { ColorModeContextProvider } from "./contexts/color-mode";
import { supabaseClient } from "./utility";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <GitHubBanner />
      <RefineKbarProvider>
        <ColorModeContextProvider>
          <Refine
            dataProvider={dataProvider(supabaseClient)}
            liveProvider={liveProvider(supabaseClient)}
            authProvider={authProvider}
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
            options={{
              syncWithLocation: true,
              warnWhenUnsavedChanges: true,
            }}
          >
            <Routes>
              <Route index element={<WelcomePage />} />
            </Routes>
            <RefineKbar />
            <UnsavedChangesNotifier />
            <DocumentTitleHandler />
          </Refine>
        </ColorModeContextProvider>
      </RefineKbarProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Today, we'll examine a few of these props so that we are ready to move to the next episode.

### The `<Refine />` Component

The [`<Refine />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/) component is the entry point of a **Refine** app. In order to leverage the power of **Refine**'s abstraction layers, we need to have the `<Refine />` component.

Then we have to configure the `<Refine />` component with the provider objects we want to use in our app. We can see that `create refine-app` already added the props for us inside `<Refine />` out-of-the-box.

We will be using them in our **Pixels** app. Some provider objects like the `routerProvider` or the `dataProvider` are defined for us by **Refine**'s core or support modules and some like the `accessControlProvider` have to be defined by ourselves.

:::caution

[`<Refine />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/) comes with [dark mode support](/core/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/theming/#theme-customization) out-of-the-box. However, we will not be using it in this series. So, we will be replace the `ColorModeContextProvider` with the `ConfigProvider`.

Also You can remove `src/context/color-mode` that comes with `create refine-app`.

```diff title="src/App.tsx"
// ...
- import { ColorModeContextProvider } from "./contexts/color-mode";
+ import { ConfigProvider } from "antd";

function App() {
    return (
            // ...
-                <ColorModeContextProvider>
+                <ConfigProvider>
                    <Refine
                    // ...
                    >
                        {/* ... */}
                    </Refine>
-                </ColorModeContextProvider>
+                </ConfigProvider>
         // ...
    );
}
```

:::

### `<Refine />`'s `dataProvider` Prop

[**Refine**'s **data provider**](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/data-provider) is the context which allows the app to communicate with a backend API via a `HTTP` client. It subsequently makes response data returned from HTTP requests available to consumer components via a set of **Refine** data hooks.

If we look closely, our `dataProvider` prop derives a value from a call to `dataProvider(supabaseClient)`:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { dataProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";

import { supabaseClient } from "./utility";

function App() {
  return <Refine dataProvider={dataProvider(supabaseClient)} />;
}
```

The returned object, also called the **`dataProvider`** object, has the following signature:

<details>
<summary>Show data provider object signature</summary>
<p>

```tsx
const dataProvider = {
  create: ({ resource, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  createMany: ({ resource, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  deleteOne: ({ resource, id, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  deleteMany: ({ resource, ids, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  getList: ({ resource, pagination, hasPagination, sort, filters, meta }) =>
    Promise,
  getMany: ({ resource, ids, meta }) => Promise,
  getOne: ({ resource, id, meta }) => Promise,
  update: ({ resource, id, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  updateMany: ({ resource, ids, variables, meta }) => Promise,
  custom: ({ url, method, sort, filters, payload, query, headers, meta }) =>
    Promise,
  getApiUrl: () => "",
};
```

</p>
</details>

Each item in this object is a method that has to be defined by us or **Refine**'s packages.

**Refine** supports [15+ backend](/core/integrations/) `dataProvider` integrations as optional packages that come with distinct definitions of these methods that handle CRUD operations according to their underlying architectures. The full list can be found [here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/packages/list-of-packages/#data-provider-packages).

Normally, for our own backend API, we have to define each method we need for sending `http` requests inside a `dataProvider` object as above. But since we are using the [`@refinedev/supabase`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/supabase) package, `dataProvider={dataProvider(supabaseClient)}` makes the following object available to us:

<details>
<summary>Show Refine supabase data provider source code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="@refinedev/supabase/src/index.ts"
import { DataProvider } from "@refinedev/core";
import { SupabaseClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { generateFilter, handleError } from "../utils";

export const dataProvider = (
  supabaseClient: SupabaseClient,
): Required<DataProvider> => {

We don't have to get into the mind of the people at **Refine** yet, but if we skim over closely, the `dataProvider` object above has pretty much every method we need to perform all CRUD operations against a **Supabase** database. Notable methods we are going to use in our app are: `create()`, `getOne()`, `getList()` and `update()`.

For the details of how these methods work, please take your time to scan through the [`dataProvider` API reference](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/).

In order to get the **Supabase** `dataProvider` object to deliver, first a `supabaseClient` has to be set up.

### **Refine**'s `supabaseClient`

If we look inside `src/utility/`, we have a `supabaseClient.ts` file containing the credentials of a client that provides us access to a **Supabase** backend:

```tsx title="src/utility/supabaseClient.ts"
import { createClient } from "@refinedev/supabase";

const SUPABASE_URL = "https://ifbdnkfqbypnkmwcfdes.supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_KEY =
  "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImlmYmRua2ZxYnlwbmttd2NmZGVzIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2NzA5MTgzOTEsImV4cCI6MTk4NjQ5NDM5MX0.ThQ40H-xay-Hi5cf7H9mKccMCvAX3iCvYVJDe0KiHtw";

export const supabaseClient = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, {
  db: {
    schema: "public",
  },
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
  },
});
```

This file was also generated for us by `create refine-app` using **Refine**'s **Supabase** package.

Inside `<Refine />` component, we are getting the value of the `dataProvider` prop by passing in `supabaseClient` to the `dataProvider()` function imported from this package:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { dataProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";

import { supabaseClient } from "./utility";

function App() {
  return <Refine dataProvider={dataProvider(supabaseClient)} />;
}
```

We need to tweak the `supabaseClient.ts` file with our own credentials, which we will do when we add `resources` to our app.

If we inspect further, setting up **Supabase** with **Refine** helps us enable not only the `dataProvider` prop, but also the `authProvider` and `liveProvider` props inside `<Refine />`. This is because they all depend on `supabaseClient` to send `http` requests. We'll explore the `liveProvider` prop on Day 4, but let's also look at the `authProvider` here to enhance our understanding.

### `<Refine />`'s `authProvider` Prop

We can clearly see in our `<Refine />` component that `create refine-app` already enabled the `authProvider` prop by passing in the corresponding object for us:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
authProvider = { authProvider };
```

Earlier on, the `authProvider` object was already created by `create refine-app` inside the `authProvider.ts` file:

</details>

This object has all the methods we need to implement an email / password based authentication and authorization system in our app.

Notice, as mentioned before, that `authProvider` relies on `supabaseClient` to connect to our **Supabase** database. So, in this case, our `authProvider` was generated as part of the **Supabase** package.

As we can infer by now, although we have stated that **Refine** performs and manages a lot of heavylifting and simplifies the app logic by dividing concerns into separate contexts, providers and hooks, _configuring_ all these providers is a heavy task itself.

It, fortunately, makes configuration easier by composing individual providers inside a single object.

These are pretty much the essentials we should get familiar with in order to accept the invitation to add `resources` to the `<Refine />` component.

## Summary

In this post, we went through the process of initializing our **Pixels** app with a **Supabase** hosted PostgreSQL database and **Ant Design** UI framework.

We then explored the boilerplate code created by `create refine-app` using **Refine**'s **Supabase** support package, especially the files related to `dataProvider` and `authProvider` props of the `<Refine />` component. We touched on setting `supabaseClient` which is used by these providers to send HTTP requests to the **Supabase** backend.

In the [next article](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication), we will use these providers to implement RESTful CRUD actions for creating a canvas, showing a canvas, drawing pixels on it and showing a public gallery that lists canvases. We will also add authentication to our app.

---

## Part 3: Adding CRUD Actions and Authentication

In this post, we build on our existing understanding of [`dataProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/data-provider) and [`authProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/authentication/auth-provider) props of [`<Refine />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/) to implement CRUD operations in our **Pixels** app that we initialized in the previous post. While doing so, we discuss the roles of `<Refine />` component's [`resources`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/guides-concepts/general-concepts/#resource-concept) and `routerProvider` props as well.

CRUD actions are supported by the [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) data provider we chose for our project and in this post we use them to build a public gallery of canvases. We implement creation and displaying of individual canvases as well as drawing on them. We also add authentication features supported by the `supabaseClient` we discussed on Day Two of the [**RefineWeek**](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine-supabase/) series.

This is Day Three and **RefineWeek** is a seven-part tutorial that aims to help developers learn the ins-and-outs of **Refine**'s powerful capabilities and get going with **Refine** within a week.

## Overview

In the last episode, we explored **Refine**'s auth and data providers in significant detail. We saw that `<Refine />`'s `dataProvider` and `authProvider` props were set to support [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) thanks to the [`@refinedev/supabase`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/packages/supabase) package.

We mentioned that `dataProvider` methods allow us to communicate with API endpoints and `authProvider` methods help us with authentication and authorization. We are able to access and invoke these methods from consumer components via their corresponding hooks.

In this post, we will be leveraging **Supabase** `dataProvider` methods to implement CRUD operations for a `canvases` resource. We are going to start by adding `canvases` as a resource on which we will be able to perform `create`, `show` and `list` actions. We will first work on a public gallery that lists all canvases and a dashboard page that shows a selection of featured canvases by implementing the `list` action. We will allow users to perform the canvas `create` action from a modal. Then we will also implement the `show` action for a canvas.

We will then apply **Supabase** auth provider to allow only logged in users to carry out `create` actions on `canvases` and `pixels`. On the way, we will explore how **Refine** does the heavylifting under the hood for us with [**React Query**](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/), and its own set of providers and hooks - making CRUD operations implementation a breeze.

But before we start, we have to set up **Supabase** with our database tables and get the access credentials.

## Setting Up Supabase for Refine

For this app, we are using a PostgreSQL database for our backend. Our database will be hosted in the **Supabase** cloud. In order to set up a PostgreSQL server, we need to sign up with [**Supabase**](https://app.supabase.com/) first.

After signing up and logging in to a developer account, we have to complete the following steps:

1. Create a PostgreSQL server with an appropriate name.
2. Create necessary tables in the database and add relationships.
3. Get API keys provided by **Supabase** for the server and set up `supabaseClient` inside our **Refine** project.

Below, we go over these steps one by one.

### 1. Creating a PostgreSQL Server with Supabase

Creating a database server is quite intuitive in **Supabase**. Just go over to your organization's dashboard and start doing something. For me, I have initialized a server with the name `refine-pixels` under a free tier. If you need a quick hand, please follow [this quickstart guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-react#create-a-project).

### 2. Adding Tables to a Supabase Database

For our app, we have four tables: `auth.users`, `public.users`, `canvases` and `pixels`. The entity relational diagram for our database looks like this:

<div className="centered-image"  >
  <img style={{alignSelf:"center"}}  src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-09-refine-pixels-3/supabase_Table.png"  alt="Supabase table editor" />
</div>

<br/>

<br />

We have a fifth, `logs` table which we are going to use for audit logging with the `auditLogProvider` on Day Seven. However, as we are progressing step by step, we are not concerned with that at the moment. We will be adding the `logs` table on its day.

In order to add the above tables to your **Supabase** database, please follow the below instructions:

**2.1 `auth.users` Table**

The `auth.users` table is concerned with authentication in our app. It is created by **Supabase** as part of its authentication module, so we don't need to do anything about it.

**Supabase** supports a myriad of third party authentication providers as well as user input based email / password authentication. In our app, we'll implement GitHub authentication besides the email / password based option.
<br />

**2.2 `public.users` Table**

**Supabase** doesn't allow a client to query the `auth.users` table for security reasons. So, we need to create a shadow of the `auth.users` table in `public.users` with additional columns. We need this shadow table to be able to query `user` information, such as `avatar_url` and `roles` from this table.

<div className="centered-image"  >
  <img style={{alignSelf:"center", width: "300px"}}  src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-09-refine-pixels-3/sql_editor.png"  alt="Supabase SQL editor" />
</div>

<br/>

<br />

So, in order to create the `public.users` table, go ahead and run this SQL script in the SQL Editor of your **Supabase** project dashboard:

```sql
-- Create a table for public users
create table users (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone,
  username text unique,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text
);

-- This trigger automatically creates a public.users entry when a new user signs up via Supabase Auth.
-- See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-user-data#using-triggers for more details.
create or replace function public.handle_new_public_user()
returns trigger as $$
begin
  insert into public.users (id, full_name, avatar_url)
  values (new.id, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url');
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_public_user();

-- Set up Storage!
insert into storage.buckets (id, name)
  values ('avatars', 'avatars');

-- Set up access controls for storage.
-- See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage#policy-examples for more details.
create policy "Avatar images are publicly accessible." on storage.objects
  for select using (bucket_id = 'avatars');

create policy "Anyone can upload an avatar." on storage.objects
  for insert with check (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

<br />

**2.3 `canvases` Table**

For the `canvases` table, run this SQL script inside the **Supabase** SQL Editor:

```sql
create table canvases (
  id text unique primary key not null,
  user_id uuid references users on delete cascade not null,
  name text not null,
  width int8 not null,
  height int8 not null,
  is_featured boolean default false not null,

  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

<br />

**2.4 `pixels` Table**

For the `pixels` table run the following SQL script:

```sql
create table pixels (
  id int8 generated by default as identity primary key not null,
  user_id uuid references users on delete cascade not null,
  canvas_id text references canvases on delete cascade not null,
  x int8 not null,
  y int8 not null,
  color text not null,

  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

If you want to create the tables using Table Editor from the dashboard, feel free to use [the Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables#creating-tables).
<br />

**2.5 Relationship Between Tables**

If we look closely, `public.users` table has a **one-to-many** relationship with `canvases` and a `canvas` must belong to a `user`.

Similarly `canvases` also has a one-to-many relationship with `pixels`. A `canvas` has many `pixels` and a `pixel` must belong to a `canvas`.

Also, `public.users` has a one-to-many relationship with `pixels`.
<br />

**2.5 Disable RLS**

For simplicity, we'll disable Row Level Security:

<div className="centered-image"  >
  <img style={{alignSelf:"center", width: "600px"}}  src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-09-refine-pixels-3/disable_rls.png"  alt="Disable RLS setting" />
</div>

<br/>

### 3. Set Up `supabaseClient` for `<Refine />` Providers

Now it's time to use the **Supabase** hosted database server inside our **Refine** app.

First, we need to get the access credentials for our server from the **Supabase** dashboard. We can avail them by following [this section](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-react#get-the-api-keys) in the **Supabase** quickstart guide.

I recommend storing these credentials in a [`.env` file](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html):

```bash title=".env"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY
```

Doing so will let us use these credentials to update the `supabaseClient.ts` file created by `refine ` at initialization:

```tsx title="supabaseClient.ts"
import { createClient } from "@refinedev/supabase";

const SUPABASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL ?? "";
const SUPABASE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY ?? "";

export const supabaseClient = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);
```

`<Refine />` component's `dataProvider`, `authProvider` and `liveProvider` objects utilize this `supabaseClient` to connect to the PostgreSQL server hosted on **Supabase**.

With this set up, now we can introduce `canvases` resource and start implementing CRUD operations for our app so that we can perform queries on the `canvases` table.

## `<Refine />`'s `resources` Prop

If we look at our initial `App.tsx` component, it looks like this:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { GitHubBanner, Refine, WelcomePage } from "@refinedev/core";
import { RefineKbar, RefineKbarProvider } from "@refinedev/kbar";

import { useNotificationProvider } from "@refinedev/antd";
import "@refinedev/antd/dist/reset.css";

import routerProvider, {
  DocumentTitleHandler,
  UnsavedChangesNotifier,
} from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { dataProvider, liveProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import authProvider from "./authProvider";
import { supabaseClient } from "./utility";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <GitHubBanner />
      <RefineKbarProvider>
        <Refine
          dataProvider={dataProvider(supabaseClient)}
          liveProvider={liveProvider(supabaseClient)}
          authProvider={authProvider}
          routerProvider={routerProvider}
          notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
          options={{
            syncWithLocation: true,
            warnWhenUnsavedChanges: true,
          }}
        >
          <Routes>
            <Route index element={<WelcomePage />} />
          </Routes>
          <RefineKbar />
          <UnsavedChangesNotifier />
          <DocumentTitleHandler />
        </Refine>
      </RefineKbarProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Focusing on the top, in order to add a resource to our app, we have to introduce the [`resources`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/guides-concepts/general-concepts/#resource-concept) prop to [`<Refine />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/). The value of `resources` prop should be an **array** of resource items with RESTful routes in our app. A typical resource object contains properties and values related to the resource `name`, `options`, and intended actions:

```json title="Typical resource object inside resources array"
{
  "name": "canvases",
  "list": "/canvases",
  "show": "/canvases/show/:id"
}
```

We can have as many resource items inside our `resources` array as the number of entities we have in our app.

**Refine** simplifies CRUD actions and acts as a bridge between the Data/API layer and the Document/Page Layer. A resource enables the application's pages to interact with the API. It's worth spending a few minutes exploring the possible properties of a resource item from the [`resources`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/#resources) docs here.

For the above `canvases` resource, the `name` property denotes the name of the resource. Behind the scenes, **Refine** auto-magically adds RESTful routes for the actions defined on a resource `name` to the `routerProvider` object - i.e. for us here along the `/canvases` path.

`list` and `show` properties represent the CRUD actions we want. And their values are the components we want to render when we navigate to their respective RESTful routes, such as `/canvases` and `/canvases/show/a-canvas-slug`.

We will use a modal form for the `create` action, so we don't need `/canvases/create` route. Therefore, we won't assign `create` property for `canvases` resource.

### Adding `resources` to `<Refine />`

For our app, we'll configure our `resources` object with actions for `canvases`. So, let's add `canvases` resource with `list` and `show` actions:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
<Refine
  // ...
  //highlight-start
  resources={[
    {
      name: "canvases",
      list: "/canvases",
      show: "/canvases/show/:id",
    },
  ]}
  //highlight-end
/>
```

We will consider these two actions with their respective components and routes in the coming sections.

We should have the `CanvasList` and `CanvasShow` components premade. In a **Refine** app, CRUD action related components are typically placed in a directory that has a structure like this: `src/pages/resource_name/`.

In our case, we'll house `canvases` related components in the `src/pages/canvases/` folder.

We are also using `index.ts` files to export contents from our folders, so that the components are easily found by the compiler in the global namespace.

### Adding required files

Here is the finalized version of what we'll be building in this article:
https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels

Before we move on, you need to add required page and components to the project if you want build the app by following the article. Please add the following components and files into the project:

- pages: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/src/pages
- components: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/src/components
- providers: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/src/providers
- utility: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/src/utility
- types: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/src/types
- styles: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/src/styles
- assets: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels/public

After creating files above you need to add some imports and [routes](/core/docs/packages/list-of-packages/) to `src/App.tsx` file. Simply add replace your App.tsx with following.

:::note

We move this files to `src/providers/authProvider.ts` and `src/components/layout/header` for better folder structure.

### `<Refine />` `list` Action

The `list` action represents a `GET` request sent to the `canvases` table in our **Supabase** db. It is done through the `dataProvider.getList` method that [`@refinedev/supabase`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/packages/supabase/src/index.ts) gave us. From the consumer `<CanvasList />` component, it can be accessed via the `useList()` hook.

**Refine** defines the routes for `list` action to be the `/canvases` path, and adds it to the `routerProvider` object. `/canvases` path, in turn, renders the `<CanvasList />` component, as specified in the `resources` array.

The contents of our `<CanvasList />` component look like this:

```tsx title="src/pages/canvases/list.tsx"
import { useSimpleList } from "@refinedev/antd";
import { List, Skeleton } from "antd";

import { CanvasTile } from "../../components/canvas";
import { SponsorsBanner } from "../../components/banners";
import { Canvas } from "../../types";

export const CanvasList: React.FC = () => {
  const { listProps, query } = useSimpleList<Canvas>({
    resource: "canvases",
    pagination: {
      pageSize: 12,
    },
    sorters: {
      initial: [
        {
          field: "created_at",
          order: "desc",
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  const { isLoading } = query;

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="paper">
        {isLoading ? (
          <div className="canvas-skeleton-list">
            {[...Array(12)].map((_, index) => (
              <Skeleton key={index} paragraph={{ rows: 8 }} />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <List
            {...listProps}
            className="canvas-list"
            split={false}
            renderItem={(canvas) => <CanvasTile canvas={canvas} />}
          />
        )}
      </div>
      <SponsorsBanner />
    </div>
  );
};
```

There are a few of things to note here: the first being the use of **Ant Design** with **Refine**'s `@refinedev/antd` module. The second thing is the `useSimpleList()` hook that is being used to access `listProps` and `query` items to feed UI elements. And third, the use of pagination and sorting in the query sent.

Let's briefly discuss what's going on:

**1. `refine-antd` and `antd` Components**

We will use the **Ant Design** [`<List />`](https://ant.design/components/list#list/) component to show the list of canvases.

[`<List />`](https://ant.design/components/list#list) component takes in the props inside `listProps` object that `useSimpleList()` hook prepares for us from the fetched canvases array and shows each canvas data inside the `<CanvasTile />` component. All the props and presentation logic are being handled inside the **Ant Design** `<List />` component.

[Refer to Ant Design documentation for more information About <List />. →](https://ant.design/components/list#list)

[Refer to complete Refine CRUD app with Ant Design tutorial here. →](https://refine.dev/core/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/introduction)

**2. `useSimpleList()` Hook**

The `useSimpleList()` is a `@refinedev/antd` hook built on top of the low level [`useList()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/hooks/use-list/) hook to fetch a resource collection. After fetching data according to the value of the `resource` property, it prepares it according to the `listProps` of the **Ant Design**'s `<List />` component.

In our `<CanvasList />` component, we are passing the `listProps` props to `<List />` in order to show a list of canvases.

Please feel free to go through the [`useSimpleList` documentation here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/list/useSimpleList/) for as much as information as you need. It makes life a lot easier while creating a dashboard or list of items.

**3. Sorting**
If you are already looking at the [`useSimpleList()` argument object's properties](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/list/useSimpleList/#properties), notice that we are able to pass options for `pagination` and `sorters.initial` for the API call and get the response accordingly.

With this set up - and connected to the Internet - if we run the dev server with `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`, we are faced with a `<CanvasFeaturedList/>` as a home page.

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/featured-canvases.jpg"  alt="Featured canvases gallery" />

<br />

This is because we have configured our routes as public. Furthermore, we have set up our `<AuthPage/>` component as a route accessible to unauthenticated users. This means that if a user is not authenticated, they can access the `<AuthPage/>` component. However, if a user is authenticated, they will not be able to access the `<AuthPage/>` component.

In this project, our goal is to allow unauthenticated users to view created canvases. However, they will not have the ability to create, update, or delete canvases.

We already did this implementation when we created required files before starting the this section. In the next section, we will explain how redirect unauthenticated users to the login page if they attempt to perform create, update, or delete actions on canvases.

### Public Routes in Refine

If we revisit the `authProvider` object, we can see that the `check()` method only allows logged in users. All other attempts are rejected. We will use this logic to compose our routes.

<details>
<summary>Show `authProvider` code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="src/authProvider.ts"
check: async () => {
    try {
            // sign in with oauth
            if (providerName) {
                const { data, error } =
                    await supabaseClient.auth.signInWithOAuth({
                        provider: providerName,
                    });

                if (error) {
                    return {
                        success: false,
                        error,
                    };
                }

                if (data?.url) {
                    return {
                        success: true,
                    };
                }
            }

            // sign in with email and password
            const { data, error } =
                await supabaseClient.auth.signInWithPassword({
                    email,
                    password,
                });

            if (error) {
                return {
                    success: false,
                    error,
                };
            }

            if (data?.user) {
                return {``
                    success: true,
                };
            }
        } catch (error: any) {
            return {
                success: false,
                error,
            };
        }

        return {
            success: false,
            error: {
                message: "Login failed",
                name: "Invalid email or password",
            },
        };
},
```

</p>
</details>

**Refine** provides [`<Authenticated/>`](/core/docs/authentication/components/authenticated/) component to protect routes from unauthenticated users. It uses `authProvider.check` method under the hood. To use this component, we need to wrap the routes we want to protect with [`<Authenticated/>`](/core/docs/authentication/components/authenticated/) component.

Let's look at the routes implementation:

            <Route index element={<CanvasFeaturedList />} />

            <Route path="/canvases">

            element={
              <Authenticated fallback={<Outlet />}>
                <NavigateToResource />
              </Authenticated>
            }
          >
            <Route
              path="/login"
              element={
                <AuthPage
                  type="login"
                  providers={[
                    {
                      name: "github",
                      icon: (

                          }}
                        />
                      ),
                      label: "Sign in with GitHub",
                    },
                  ]}
                />
              }
            />
            <Route path="/register" element={<AuthPage type="register" />} />
            <Route
              path="/forgot-password"
              element={<AuthPage type="forgotPassword" />}
            />
            <Route
              path="/update-password"
              element={<AuthPage type="updatePassword" />}
            />
          </Route>
        </Routes>
      </Refine>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

</p>
</details>

In this example we didn't wrap our `canvases` resource routes with [`<Authenticated/>`](/core/docs/authentication/components/authenticated/) component. This means that we can access the `canvases` resource routes without being authenticated.

However, we use `login`, `register`, `forgot-password` and `update-password` routes as a `fallback` of [`<Authenticated/>`](/core/docs/authentication/components/authenticated/) component. This means that we can not access these routes if we are authenticated.

[Refer to the Auth Provider tutorial for more information. →](/core/docs/authentication/auth-provider/)

### `<Refine />` `create` Action

The `create` action represents a `POST` request sent to the `canvases` table in our **Supabase** database. It is done with the `dataProvider.create()` method that `@refinedev/supabase` package gave us.

We are presenting the canvas form inside a modal contained in a `<CreateCanvas />` component, which is placed in the `<Header />` component. And the modal is accessed with a `Create` canvas button we have in the `<Header />`.

The `<Header />` component looks like this:

<details>
<summary>Show Header component code</summary>

```tsx title="src/components/layout/header/index.tsx"
import React from "react";
import {
  useIsAuthenticated,
  useLogout,

  useNavigation,
  useParsed,
} from "@refinedev/core";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { useModalForm } from "@refinedev/antd";

import {
  PlusSquareOutlined,
  LogoutOutlined,
  LoginOutlined,
} from "@ant-design/icons";
import { Button, Image, Space } from "antd";

import { CreateCanvas } from "../../../components/canvas";
import { Canvas } from "../../../types";

export const Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { data } = useIsAuthenticated();
  const { mutate: mutateLogout } = useLogout();
  const { push } = useNavigation();
  const { selectedKey } = useMenu();
  const { pathname } = useParsed();

  const { modalProps, formProps, show } = useModalForm<Canvas>({
    resource: "canvases",
    action: "create",
    redirect: "show",
  });

  const isAuthenticated = data?.authenticated;

  const handleRedirect = () => {
    if (!pathname) {
      return push("/login");
    }

    if (pathname === "/") {
      return push("/login");
    }

    push(`/login?to=${encodeURIComponent(pathname)}`);
  };

              }
            }}

          >
            Create
          </Button>
          {isAuthenticated ? (
            <Button
              type="primary"
              danger
              onClick={() => {
                mutateLogout();
              }}
              icon={<LogoutOutlined />}
              title="Logout"
            />
          ) : (
            <Button
              type="primary"
              onClick={() => {
                handleRedirect();
              }}
              icon={<LoginOutlined />}
              title="Login"
            >
              Login
            </Button>
          )}
        </Space>
      </div>
      <CreateCanvas modalProps={modalProps} formProps={formProps} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

</p>
</details>

Our `create` action involves the `useModalForm()` hook which manages UI, state, error and data fetching for the `antd` `<Modal />` and `<Form />` components. Let's zoom in on what exactly it is doing.

**The `useModalForm()` Hook**

In the `<Header />` component above, we are invoking the `useModalForm()` hook with its argument object containing `resource`, `action` and `redirect` properties. We are getting the `modalProps` and `formProps` properties that it prepares for us from the response data.

There are loads of things happening here. So I recommend going through the [`useModalForm()` documentation](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/form/useModalForm/).

It is also important that we understand how the **Ant Design**
`<Modal />` component accepts the `modalProps` props from [this page](https://ant.design/components/modal#api) and how the `<Form />` works with `formProps` from [here](https://ant.design/components/form#api).

We are using the `<Modal />` and `<Form />` inside the `<CreateCanvas />` component that receives the `modalProps` and `formProps` and relays them to these descendents:

<details>
<summary>CreateCanvas component code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="src/components/canvas/create.tsx"
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useGetIdentity } from "@refinedev/core";
import { Form, FormProps, Input, Modal, ModalProps, Radio } from "antd";

import { getRandomName, DEFAULT_CANVAS_SIZE } from "../../utility";
import { User } from "../../types";

type CreateCanvasProps = {
  modalProps: ModalProps;
  formProps: FormProps;
};

export const CreateCanvas: React.FC<CreateCanvasProps> = ({
  modalProps,
  formProps,
}) => {
  const { data: user } = useGetIdentity<User | null>();

  const [values, setValues] = useState(() => {
    const name = getRandomName();
    return {
      name: name,
      id: name.replace(/\s/g, "-").toLowerCase(),
      width: DEFAULT_CANVAS_SIZE,
      height: DEFAULT_CANVAS_SIZE,
    };
  });

  return (
    <Modal
      {...modalProps}
      title="Create Canvas"
      width={600}
      centered
      afterClose={() => {
        const name = getRandomName();
        setValues({
          name: name,
          id: name.replace(/\s/g, "-").toLowerCase(),
          width: DEFAULT_CANVAS_SIZE,
          height: DEFAULT_CANVAS_SIZE,
        });
      }}
      bodyStyle={{ borderRadius: "6px" }}
    >
      <Form
        {...formProps}
        labelCol={{ span: 6 }}
        wrapperCol={{ span: 12 }}
        onFinish={() => {
          return (
            formProps.onFinish &&
            formProps.onFinish({
              ...values,
              user_id: user?.id,
            })
          );
        }}
      >
        <Form.Item label="ID:">
          <Input value={values.id} disabled />
        </Form.Item>

        <Form.Item label="Name:">
          <Input value={values.name} disabled />
        </Form.Item>

        <Form.Item label="Size:">
          <Radio.Group
            options={[10, 20, 30]}
            onChange={({ target: { value } }) =>
              setValues((p) => ({
                ...p,
                height: value,
                width: value,
              }))
            }
            value={values.width}
            optionType="button"
            buttonStyle="solid"
          />
        </Form.Item>
      </Form>
    </Modal>
  );
};
```

</p>
</details>

Notice the use of the `formProps.onFinish()` method on `<Form />`'s `onFinish` prop. This is the form event which initiates the `create` action.

Behind the scenes, `useModalForm()` ultimately calls the `useCreate()` data hook which fetches the data with the `dataProvider.create()` method.

For details about how the `useCreate()` hook works, please refer to [this **Refine** documentation](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/hooks/use-create/).

Notice also that we are passing the `redirect` property to the `useModalForm()` hook which specifies that we redirect to the `show` action of the resource. We'll come to this in the next section related to adding `show` action in our `canvases` resource.

If we now click on the `Create` button in our navbar, we will be again redirected to the `/login` page.

This is because for the `onClick` event on the `Create` canvas button inside the `<Header />` component, we have asked the router to authenticate the user if they are not logged in:

```tsx title="src/components/layout/header/index.tsx"
<Button
  icon={<PlusSquareOutlined />}
  onClick={() => {
    if (isLogin) {
      show();
    } else {
      handleRedirect();
    }
  }}
  title="Create a new canvas"
>
  Create
</Button>
```

## `<Refine />` `show` Action

We noted in the previous section that after a successful `create` action, `useModalForm()` is set to redirect the page to the `show` action.

The `show` action represents a `GET` request to the `canvases` table in our **Supabase** database. It is done with the `dataProvider.getOne()` method. In the `<CanvasShow />` component, it can be accessed via the `useShow()` hook.

The `<CanvasShow />` component looks like this:

<details>
<summary>CanvasShow component code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="src/pages/canvases/show.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import {
  useCreate,
  useGetIdentity,

import { CanvasItem, DisplayCanvas } from "../../components/canvas";

import { AvatarPanel } from "../../components/avatar";
import { colors } from "../../utility";
import { Canvas } from "../../types";
import { LogList } from "../../components/logs";

const { Title } = Typography;

type Colors = typeof colors;

export const CanvasShow: React.FC = () => {
  const { pathname } = useParsed();
  const [color, setColor] = useState<Colors[number]>("black");
  const { modalProps, show, close } = useModal();
  const { data: identity } = useGetIdentity<any>();
  const { data: { authenticated } = {} } = useIsAuthenticated();

  const {
    query: { data: { data: canvas } = {} },
  } = useShow<Canvas>();
  const { mutate } = useCreate();
  const { list, push } = useNavigation();

  const onSubmit = (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!authenticated) {
      if (pathname) {
        return push(`/login?to=${encodeURIComponent(pathname)}`);
      }

      return push(`/login`);
    }

    if (typeof x === "number" && typeof y === "number" && canvas?.id) {
      mutate({
        resource: "pixels",
        values: {
          x,
          y,
          color,

          user_id: identity.id,
        },
        meta: {
          canvas,
        },
        successNotification: false,
      });
    }
  };

                  />
                  <div style={{ width: 120 }}>
                    <AvatarPanel pixels={pixels} />
                  </div>
                </div>
              ) : (
                <div className="spin-wrapper">
                  <Spin />
                </div>
              )
            }
          </DisplayCanvas>
        ) : (
          <div className="spin-wrapper">
            <Spin />
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</p>
</details>

In the code above, we have two instances of data hooks in action. First, with the `useShow()` hook, we are getting the created `canvas` data to display it in the grid:

```tsx title="src/pages/canvases/show.tsx"
const {
  query: { data: { data: canvas } = {} },
} = useShow<Canvas>();
```

Additionally, we are letting another `mutation` to create a `pixel` in our `pixels` table with the following:

```tsx title="src/pages/canvases/show.tsx"
const { mutate } = useCreate();

const onSubmit = (x: number, y: number) => {
  if (typeof x === "number" && typeof y === "number" && canvas?.id) {
    mutate({
      resource: "pixels",
      values: { x, y, color, canvas_id: canvas?.id },
    });
  }
};
```

Now that we have our `<CanvasShow />` component ready, let's start implementing **Supabase** authentication for our app.

## Supabase Authentication with Refine

[Refer to the Auth Provider tutorial for more information. →](/core/docs/authentication/auth-provider/)

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
<Refine
  // ...
  authProvider={authProvider}
/>
```

If we click on the `Create` canvas button, we are redirected to `/login` route.

### Email Authentication with Supabase in Refine

For implementing authentication, we look back at the `App.tsx` file.

**Refine**'s **Supabase** module has produced all the auth page variations we need to register an account, login, recover password and update password - along with the code for routing, `https` requests and authentication providers.

Namely, authentication related routing has been added:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine, Authenticated } from "@refinedev/core";
import routerProvider, { NavigateToResource } from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { GithubOutlined } from "@ant-design/icons";
import { AuthPage } from "./pages/auth";
import { authProvider } from "./providers";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Refine
        // ...
        authProvider={authProvider}
        routerProvider={routerProvider}
      >
        <Routes>
          {/* ... */}
          {/* highlight-start */}
          <Route
            element={
              <Authenticated fallback={<Outlet />}>
                <NavigateToResource />
              </Authenticated>
            }
          >
            <Route
              path="/login"
              element={
                <AuthPage
                  type="login"
                  providers={[
                    {
                      name: "github",
                      icon: (
                        <GithubOutlined
                          style={{
                            fontSize: "18px",
                          }}
                        />
                      ),
                      label: "Sign in with GitHub",
                    },
                  ]}
                />
              }
            />
            <Route path="/register" element={<AuthPage type="register" />} />
            <Route
              path="/forgot-password"
              element={<AuthPage type="forgotPassword" />}
            />
            <Route
              path="/update-password"
              element={<AuthPage type="updatePassword" />}
            />
          </Route>
          {/* highlight-end */}
        </Routes>
      </Refine>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

The `LoginPage` route was also added:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
<Route
  path="/login"
  element={
    <AuthPage
      type="login"
      providers={[
        {
          name: "github",
          icon: (
            <GithubOutlined
              style={{
                fontSize: "18px",
              }}
            />
          ),
          label: "Sign in with GitHub",
        },
      ]}
    />
  }
/>
```

**Custom Login**

In order to add a custom login route, we add a new `<Route/>` as children to the `<Routes/>` component.

Remember, we've already replaced `App.tx` code with the following:

          </Routes>
        </Refine>
      </ConfigProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</p>
</details>

We are also using a customized version of the [`<AuthPage />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/components/antd-auth-page/) component now. We will not discuss about customizing the `<AuthPage />` component since it is pretty straight forward. But you can find the updated `<AuthPage />` component in the `src/pages/auth` directory.

If you haven't already, it is definitely worth spending time to go over the `<AuthPage />` customization details [here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/components/antd-auth-page).
<br />

**Registering an Account**

Since we haven't created any account with the `auth.users` table on our **Supabase** server, we need to navigate to the `/register` route where we are presented with the customized sign up form.

At this point, if we register with our email and a password, it gets added to the `auth.users` table in **Supabase**.

After registration, the user is automatically signed in and the browser redirects to the root route, which takes us to the `/canvases` route thanks to **Refine**'s sensible routing defaults.

And now, since we are logged in, we should be able to create a canvas. After successful creation of a canvas, we should be redirected to `/canvases/:id`:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/create-canvas.jpg"  alt="Create canvas form" />

<br />

Feel free to create a few more canvases and draw on them so that the gallery gets populated.

With the main features functioning now, let's focus on adding and activating third party authentication.

We have a `providers` prop on `<AuthPage />`. We want to add GitHub authentication as well.

### GitHub Authentication with Supabase in Refine

We implemented GitHub authentication with **Supabase** in our app.

In order to do so, we just need to add the following object to the `providers` prop in `<AuthPage />` component:

```json
{
  name: "github",
  icon: <GithubOutlined style={{ fontSize: "18px" }} />,
  label: "Sign in with GitHub",
}
```

In our **Supabase** backend, we have to configure and enable GitHub authentication. Feel free to use this [**Supabase** guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-github).

And now we should be able to sign in to our app with GitHub as well.

## Implementing a Public Home Page with Refine

Now it's time to focus on the Home page of our application. We put the `<CanvasFeaturedList />` in this page:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import routerProvider from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { Layout } from "./components/layout";
import { CanvasFeaturedList } from "./pages/canvases";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Refine
        // ...
        routerProvider={routerProvider}
      >
        <Routes>
          {/* ... */}
          <Route
            element={
              <Layout>
                <Outlet />
              </Layout>
            }
          >
            {/* highlight-start */}
            <Route index element={<CanvasFeaturedList />} />
            {/* highlight-end */}
            {/* ... */}
          </Route>
        </Routes>
      </Refine>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

So, now if we visit the root route we can see the `<CanvasFeaturedList />` component, and not the `<CanvasList />` component.

There will not be any item in the home page because `is_featured` is set to `false` for a canvas by default. At this stage, in order to get a list of featured canvases, we have to set `is_featured: true` from **Supabase** dashboard for some of the canvases created.

I've done that and the featured canvases are listed in the `Home` route:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/featured-canvases.jpg"  alt="Featured canvases gallery" />

<br />

## Summary

In this post, we added `canvases` resource to our `<Refine />` component. We implemented `list` action on a public gallery and a dashboard page and the `show` action to display a canvas. The `create` action is implemented from inside a modal accessible on a button click. While working through these, we inspected into individual data provider methods and hooks for these actions.

We also saw how **Refine** handles a simple email/password based authentication out-of-the-box. We then went ahead implemented social login using `GitHub` authentication provider.

In the next article, we'll move things to the next level by adding live collaboration features using **Refine**'s **Supabase** `liveProvider`.

---

## Part 4: Adding Realtime Collaboration

In this post, we implement realtime broadcast and subscription of `pixels` updates in our **Refine** based **Pixels** app. We do this with the [`liveProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/) prop on `<Refine />` and [**Supabase**'s **Realtime servers**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime). Applying a PubSub feature allows us to receive instant updates in one part of our app for database changes triggered from another part or by a different client.

Here's a quick rundown of the features we'll work on:

1. Allow multiple users to draw pixels on a canvas.
2. All contributors can see realtime updates on the canvas.

This is Day 4 in the series titled [**RefineWeek**](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine/). **RefineWeek** is a quickfire tutorial guide that aims to help developers learn the ins-and-outs of **Refine**'s powerful capabilities and get going with **Refine** within a week.

## Overview

On Day Three, we implemented CRUD operations using **Supabase** `dataProvider` methods and the `resources` prop, which leveraged RESTful routes in the [`routerProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/) object under the hood.

Today, we are going to explore the [`liveProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/) prop as we implement realtime collaboration on a `canvas` so that `pixels` drawn on a `canvas` by one user is instantly seen by anyone else viewing it from another client.

There are two parts to our endeavor in this post, one in the **Supabase** backend and one in our **Refine** app:

1. Spin up Realtime servers from **Supabase** dashboard for the resource we want to publish changes for and subscribe to.
2. Registering the `liveProvider` prop inside `<Refine />` component and enabling subscription with `liveMode: auto`.

**Refine** has already added the implementation code for **Supabase** **Realtime** provider in the `liveProvider` object it created for us during project initialization. We will mostly play the laymen role here as we tour around the underlying principles and the magic at work behind the scenes.

Let's start by first making sure **Realtime** servers are set up for the `pixels` table in the **Supabase** backend.

## Setting Up Supabase Realtime

In order to make drawing collaborative between our users, we have to run [**Supabase** **Realtime**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime) servers and create channels for our `pixels` resource.

We can do this from the **Supabase** dashboard for the database we created. If you haven't already, please go ahead and select `Enable Realtime` for the `pixels` table from its editor:

<div className="centered-image"  >
   <img style={{alignSelf:"center"}}  src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog%2F2023-02-11-refine-pixels-4%2Frealtime.png"  alt="Supabase realtime data synchronization diagram" />
</div>

<br/>

Behind the scenes, **Supabase** spins up globally distributed **Realtime** servers that facilitate low latency communication between our app and **Supabase** database tables. **Supabase**'s **Realtime** feature spares a **channel** for each resource to be broadcasted. Any change in the resource is published in the channel, and clients that subscribe to the channel receive updates as soon as the change is made.

We are using **Supabase** **Realtime**'s [**PostgreSQL Change Data Capture**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime#postgres-cdc) feature which will now allow our app to publish mutation events to the `pixels` channel and also listen to those changes from a subscriber component.

This means mutation hooks such as [`useCreate()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/hooks/use-create/) can now publish events to the `pixels` channel and consumer hooks like [`useList()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/hooks/use-list/) are able to get instant updates for any change to `pixels`.

## `<Refine />`'s `liveProvider` Prop

Now, it's time to move our attention back to the `<Refine />` component in our app.

We already have the `liveProvider` prop passed in with the `liveProvider()` function from `@refinedev/supabase`:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { liveProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";
import { supabaseClient } from "./utility";

function App() {
  return (
    <Refine
      // ...
      liveProvider={liveProvider(supabaseClient)}
    />
  );
}
```

And that's it! The channel for `pixels` resource that was specified above in **Supabase** will broadcast all mutations on the `pixels` table. And any subscriber will be able to receive real time updates about the changes.

Now, let's try opening the app in two browsers, one with Google account and one with GitHub. Navigate to a canvas page, the same one in both and try adding some `pixels` from each. We'll see that `pixel`s created in one are displayed in the other in real time:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/live-provider.avif"  alt="Live provider implementation for real-time updates" />

<br />

This looks like a magic, because we don't know how this is happening. And very pleasant because `create refine-app` already generated the code that handles the PubSub logic for **Supabase** **PostregSQL CDC**. Let's have a look to see what's happening in the **Supabase** `liveProvider` object.

### Refine's Supabase `liveProvider` Object

**Refine**'s `liveProvider` object has the following signature:

```tsx
const liveProvider = {
	subscribe: ({ channel, params: { ids }, types, callback }) => any,
	unsubscribe: (subscription) => void,
	publish?: (event) => void,
};
```

In [`@refinedev/supabase`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/packages/supabase/src/liveProvider/index.ts) `version 5.0.0`, at the time of publishing this article, the `liveProvider` consists of only the `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods. Its implementation looks like this:

Let's have a look.

<details>
<summary>Show `liveProvider` code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="@refinedev/supabase liveProvider"
import { LiveProvider, CrudFilter, CrudFilters } from "@refinedev/core";
import {
  RealtimeChannel,
  RealtimePostgresChangesPayload,
  SupabaseClient,
} from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { liveTypes, supabaseTypes } from "../types";
import { mapOperator } from "../utils";

export const liveProvider = (supabaseClient: SupabaseClient): LiveProvider => {
  return {
    subscribe: ({ channel, types, params, callback }): RealtimeChannel => {
      const resource = channel.replace("resources/", "");

      const listener = (payload: RealtimePostgresChangesPayload<any>) => {
        if (
          types.includes("*") ||
          types.includes(liveTypes[payload.eventType])
        ) {
          if (
            liveTypes[payload.eventType] !== "created" &&
            params?.ids !== undefined &&
            payload.new?.id !== undefined
          ) {
            if (params.ids.map(String).includes(payload.new.id.toString())) {
              callback({
                channel,
                type: liveTypes[payload.eventType],
                date: new Date(payload.commit_timestamp),
                payload: payload.new,
              });
            }
          } else {
            callback({
              channel,
              type: liveTypes[payload.eventType],
              date: new Date(payload.commit_timestamp),
              payload: payload.new,
            });
          }
        }
      };

      const mapFilter = (filters?: CrudFilters): string | undefined => {
        if (!filters || filters?.length === 0) {
          return;
        }

        return filters
          .map((filter: CrudFilter): string | undefined => {
            if ("field" in filter) {
              return `${filter.field}=${mapOperator(filter.operator)}.${
                filter.value
              }`;
            }
            return;
          })
          .filter(Boolean)
          .join(",");
      };

      const client = supabaseClient.channel("any").on(
        "postgres_changes",
        {
          event: supabaseTypes[types[0]] as any,
          schema: "public",
          table: resource,
          filter: mapFilter(params?.filters),
        },
        listener,
      );

      return client.subscribe();
    },

    unsubscribe: async (channel: RealtimeChannel) => {
      supabaseClient.removeChannel(channel);
    },
  };
};
```

</p>
</details>

Both methods are concerned with subscription to the changes. That's because the publishing the event is done by mutation methods. In our case, it is done from the [`useCreate()`](/core/docs/data/hooks/use-create/) hook we invoke to create a pixel.

## Broadcasting

If we look inside our `<CanvasShow />` component that is rendered at `/canvases/:id`, we have a `<CanvasItem />` component which basically displays all `pixel`s that belong to the `canvas` item being visited. `<CanvasItem />` is also the component from where a `pixel` is created, so let's look at that now:

```tsx title="src/pages/components/canvas/item.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { Typography } from "antd";

import { Pixel, Canvas } from "../../types";
import { DEFAULT_SCALE, PIXEL_SIZE } from "../../utility/constants";

const { Text } = Typography;

type CanvasItemProps = {
  canvas: Canvas;
  pixels: Pixel[] | undefined;
  scale?: number;
  border?: boolean;
  active?: boolean;
  onPixelClick?: (x: number, y: number) => void;
};

export const CanvasItem: React.FC<CanvasItemProps> = ({
  canvas: { id, name, width, height },
  pixels,
  scale = DEFAULT_SCALE,
  border = true,
  active = true,
  onPixelClick,
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {Array.from({ length: height }).map((_, i) => (
        <div key={`row-${i}`} style={{ display: "flex" }}>
          {Array.from({ length: width }).map((_, j) => (
            <div key={`row-${i}-col-${j}`}>
              <div
                onClick={() => {
                  if (onPixelClick && active) {
                    onPixelClick(j, i);
                  }
                }}
                style={{
                  cursor: active ? "pointer" : undefined,
                  width: PIXEL_SIZE * scale,
                  height: PIXEL_SIZE * scale,
                  border: border ? "0.5px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.05)" : undefined,
                  background:
                    pixels?.find((el) => el.x === j && el.y === i)?.color ??
                    "transparent",
                }}
              />
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      ))}
      {!active && <Text className="canvas-name-text">{name ?? id}</Text>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The most relevant thing to look in the component above is the `onPixelClick` click event handler. It is a prop received by the `<CanvasItem />` from the `<CanvasShow />` component. It's original value is the `onSubmit()` function defined inside the `<CanvasShow />` component.

We'd like to focus on this `onSubmit` event handler, because it is what facilitates the creation of a `pixel`:

```tsx title="src/pages/canvases/show.tsx"
import { useCreate, useNavigation } from "@refinedev/core";

export const CanvasShow: React.FC = () => {
  // ...

  const { push } = useNavigation();
  const { mutate } = useCreate();

  const onSubmit = (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!authenticated) {
      if (pathname) {
        return push(`/login?to=${encodeURIComponent(pathname)}`);
      }

      return push(`/login`);
    }

    if (typeof x === "number" && typeof y === "number" && canvas?.id) {
      mutate({
        resource: "pixels",
        values: {
          x,
          y,
          color,
          canvas_id: canvas?.id,
          user_id: identity.id,
        },
        meta: {
          canvas,
        },
        successNotification: false,
      });
    }
  };

  return /* ... */;
};
```

As we can see, with the call to `mutate` method of the `useCreate()` hook, a new entry is being added to the `pixels` table upon every click on the canvas.

And since we enabled realtime for the `pixels` table, each successful `create` action broadcasts the change to the `pixels` channel for subscribers to pick.
<br />

### Refine [`usePublish()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/live/usePublish/) Hook

The exact way it happens looks like this:

1. `useCreate()` hook is called from the consumer component.
2. `useCreate()`, behind the scenes, uses the live `usePublish()` hook to publish the `created` event to the `pixels` channel on **Supabase** **Realtime** servers.

The published event for `pixels` `create` action produces an object with the following signature:

```tsx
{
	channel: `resources/pixels`,
	type: "created",
	payload: {
			ids: ["id-of-created-pixel"]
	},
	date: new Date(),
}
```

Feel free to go through the [live hooks docs](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/#publish-events-from-hooks) for details about how live publishing is supported by `useCreate()` and other mutation hooks.

## Subscription

The changes to the `pixels` table can be subscribed by consumer components with the `useList()` hook. We are showing the `pixels` inside the `<CanvasShow />` component itself, but they are fetched inside the `<DisplayCanvas />` render-props component.

The `useList()` hook inside `<DisplayCanvas />` looks like this:

```tsx title="src/components/canvas/display.tsx"
import React, { ReactElement } from "react";
import { useList } from "@refinedev/core";

import { Canvas } from "../../types/canvas";
import { Pixel } from "../../types/pixel";

type DisplayCanvasProps = {
  canvas: Canvas;
  children: (pixels: Pixel[] | undefined) => ReactElement;
};

export const DisplayCanvas: React.FC<DisplayCanvasProps> = ({
  canvas: { id },
  children,
}) => {
  const { result } = useList<Pixel>({
    resource: "pixels",
    liveMode: "auto",
    meta: {
      select: "*, users(id, full_name, avatar_url)",
    },
    filters: [
      {
        field: "canvas_id",
        operator: "eq",
        value: id,
      },
    ],
    sorters: [
      {
        field: "created_at",
        order: "desc",
      },
    ],
    pagination: {
      mode: "off",
    },
  });

  const pixels = data?.data;

  return <>{children(pixels)}</>;
};
```

Among the loads of arguments and options passed to the `useList()` hook, we have used the `liveMode: auto` property which allows us to subscribe to the **Realtime** channel for the `pixels` resource.

With `liveProvider` disabled in the `<Refine />` component, `useList()` acts as a normal `dataProvider` hook.

With `liveProvider` activated, under the hood, `useList()` banks on **Refine**'s `useResourceSubscription()` live hook to communicate with the `pixels` channel.

### Refine `useResourceSubscription()` Hook

The actual subscription is done by the `liveProvider.subscribe()` method.

The `subscribe()` method is called from inside the `useResourceSubscription()` hook in order to subscribe to the `pixels` channel.

If you want to dive into the details, please feel free to do so in the [`liveProvider` docs here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/).

## Summary

In today's part, we implemented real time collaboration for drawing `pixels` on `canvas` items using `<Refine />` component's `liveProvider` prop and its supporting hooks for publishing and subscribing to **Supabase**'s **Realtime** servers.

The `subscribe()` method on **Supabase**'s `liveProvider` object allows us to subscribe to a channel created for a resource. Subscription for the resource is triggered by the `useResourceSubscription()` hook called from data hooks that support live subscription - the `useList()` hook in our example.

Broadcasting, in turn, is initiated by the `usePublish()` hook called from a supported mutation hook for our resource - the `useCreate()` hook in this case.

We implemented real time collaboration very effortlessly due to the out-of-box solutions provided by **Refine**'s `@refinedev/supabase` package.

With this now, we have enabled multiple users to draw on a canvas at the same time and receive updates instantly.

## Part 5: Creating an Admin Dashboard with Refine

This post is the first part of an admin dashboard app built using [**Refine**](https://github.com/refinedev/refine). The dashboard is an admin backend for the **Pixels** client that we built previously in the [**RefineWeek**](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine/) series. We are using the same [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) database for this app and have [**Ant Design**](https://ant.design/) as the UI framework.

This is Day 5, and **RefineWeek** is a seven-part tutorial series that aims to help developers learn the ins-and-outs of **Refine**'s powerful capabilities within a week.

- You can find the complete source code for the **Pixels Admin** app on [GitHub](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin)
- Also **Pixel Client** app source code from previous days can be found [here](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels)

## Overview

In this episode, we implement user authentication and CRUD functionalities of the dashboard. As it was in the case of the **Pixels** client app, for this app also, we implement an email-based authentication along with social logins with Google and GitHub.

We use the same **Supabase** client for connecting to the database we already have in place for the **Pixels** app.

The dashboard shows a list of all users. It also has a list for canvases.

The user list is read only and the canvas list will eventually allow editors and admins - particular to their roles - to manipulate their subject data. We will implement proper authorization for editor and admin roles on Day 6, but for now we will implement relevant CRUD operations that will apply to any authenticated user.

For the API requests, we will be using the `dataProvider` object **Refine** gave us for **Supabase**. Since we covered CRUD related concepts and architecture in depth on [Day 3](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication), in this post, we'll focus more on the **Ant Design** components side.

Let's begin with the project set up.

## Project Setup

As done previously in the client app, let's initialize our admin app with `create refine-app`. We will choose the interactive option by answering necessary questions. Let's run the following command:

```bash
npm create refine-app@latest pixels-admin
```

We will use **Supabase** for our backend, and **Ant Design** for our UI. We want to be able to customize the **Ant Design** theme and layout. So, we have the below answers related to **Supabase** and **Ant Design**:

```bash
✔ Choose a project template · Refine(Vite)
✔ What would you like to name your project?: · pixels-admin
✔ Choose your backend service to connect: · Supabase
✔ Do you want to use a UI Framework?: · Ant Design
✔ Do you want to add example pages?: · no
✔ Do you need i18n (Internationalization) support?: · no
✔ Choose a package manager: · npm
```

After completion of the initialization process, we should have the same **Refine**, **Supabase** and **Ant Design** boilerplate code generated for us like before.

We'll start tweaking the relevant code straight away as we add features to our app - since we have already explored the boilerplate code in significant depth on Day 2 in [Setting Up the Client App](#part-2-setting-up-the-client-app) and on Day 3 in [Adding CRUD Actions and Authentication](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication). This will give us more time to focus on related **Ant Design** components and what they handle for us in the background.

Prior to that, let's just navigate to the project folder and run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And prepare ourselves to the call-to-action at `http://localhost:5173`:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/welcome.jpg"  alt="Pixels admin welcome screen" />

<br />

The `App.tsx` file should be familiar from [Day 2](#part-2-setting-up-the-client-app). It looks like this:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { GitHubBanner, Refine, WelcomePage } from "@refinedev/core";
import { RefineKbar, RefineKbarProvider } from "@refinedev/kbar";

import { useNotificationProvider } from "@refinedev/antd";
import "@refinedev/antd/dist/reset.css";

import routerProvider, {
  DocumentTitleHandler,
  UnsavedChangesNotifier,
} from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { dataProvider, liveProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import authProvider from "./authProvider";
import { ColorModeContextProvider } from "./contexts/color-mode";
import { supabaseClient } from "./utility";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <GitHubBanner />
      <RefineKbarProvider>
        <ColorModeContextProvider>
          <Refine
            dataProvider={dataProvider(supabaseClient)}
            liveProvider={liveProvider(supabaseClient)}
            authProvider={authProvider}
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
            options={{
              syncWithLocation: true,
              warnWhenUnsavedChanges: true,
            }}
          >
            <Routes>
              <Route index element={<WelcomePage />} />
            </Routes>
            <RefineKbar />
            <UnsavedChangesNotifier />
            <DocumentTitleHandler />
          </Refine>
        </ColorModeContextProvider>
      </RefineKbarProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Let's start modifying the existing code to meet our requirements.

## Setting Up Supabase Config

For the admin app, we'll connect to the same PostgreSQL database already up and running on **Supabase** for the **Pixels** client app.

So, we need to get the access credentials for our server from the **Supabase** dashboard. We can avail them by following [this section in the **Supabase** quickstart guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-react#get-the-api-keys). Let's store them in an `.env` file.

We'll go ahead and update the `supabaseClient.ts` file:

```tsx title="src/utility/supabaseClient.ts"
import { createClient } from "@refinedev/supabase";

const SUPABASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL ?? "";
const SUPABASE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY ?? "";

export const supabaseClient = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);
```

Now we have enabled `authProvider` and `dataProvider` methods to connect to our **Supabase** database with `supabaseClient()`.

## Adding required files

[Here is the finalized version of what we’ll be building in this article:](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin)

Before we move on, you need to add required page and components to the project if you want build the app by following the article . Please add the following components and files into src folder in the project:

- pages: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/pages
- components: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/components
- providers: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/providers
- utility: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/utility
- casbin: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/casbin
- types: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/types
- assets: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin/public

:::danger Important

In order to run the app without warnings you need to follow [Casbin RBAC system installation step(Browser Fallbacks for Casbin).](#casbin-installation)

:::

After creating files above you need to add some imports and [routes](/core/docs/packages/list-of-packages/) to `src/App.tsx` file. Simply add replace your App.tsx with following.

:::note

[`<Refine />`](/core/docs/core/refine-component/) comes with [dark mode support](/core/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/theming/#switching-to-dark-theme) out-of-the-box. However, we will not be using it in this series. So, after copied `App.tsx` you will see that we have already replaced `ColorModeContextProvider` with the `ConfigProvider`.

Also, you can remove `src/context/color-mode` that comes with `create refine-app`.

## Creating a Table View With Refine and Ant Design

Our `<UserList />` component looks like this:

<details>
<summary>Show UserList code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="pages/users/list.tsx"
import { useTable, List } from "@refinedev/antd";
import { Table, Avatar } from "antd";
import { UserOutlined } from "@ant-design/icons";

import { TUser } from "../../types/user";

export const UserList = () => {
  const { tableProps } = useTable<TUser>();

  return (
    <List>
      <Table {...tableProps} rowKey={"id"}>
        <Table.Column
          dataIndex="avatar_url"
          title={
            <h4 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Avatar</h4>
          }
          render={(_, record: TUser) => (
            <Avatar
              icon={<UserOutlined />}
              src={record.avatar_url}
              size={{ xs: 24, sm: 32, md: 40 }}
            />
          )}
        />
        <Table.Column
          dataIndex="id"
          title={
            <h4 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>ID</h4>
          }
          render={(_, record: TUser) => (
            <p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>{record?.id}</p>
          )}
        />
        <Table.Column
          dataIndex="email"
          title={

            <h4 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
              Full Name
            </h4>
          }
          render={(_, record: TUser) =>
            record.full_name ? (
              <p
                style={{
                  textAlign: "center",
                }}
              >
                {record.full_name}
              </p>
            ) : (
              <p
                style={{
                  textAlign: "center",
                  fontWeight: "bold",
                }}
              >
                --
              </p>
            )
          }
        />
        <Table.Column
          dataIndex="username"
          title={
            <h4 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
              Username
            </h4>
          }
          render={(_, record: TUser) =>
            record.username ? (
              <p
                style={{
                  textAlign: "center",
                  fontWeight: "bold",
                }}
              >
                {record.username}
              </p>
            ) : (
              <p
                style={{
                  textAlign: "center",
                  fontWeight: "bold",
                }}
              >
                --
              </p>
            )
          }
        />
      </Table>
    </List>
  );
};
```

</p>
</details>

The components tree looks very plain, but there is plenty going on in there. Firstly, the `useTable()` hook that handles all the data fetching stuff with **React Query** in the background. The `<List />` and `<Table />` components also do intense secret service for us. We'll go over them one by one below.

### Refine Ant Design `useTable()` Hook

[`useTable()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/table/useTable/) is a **Refine** **Ant Design** hook served to us from the `@refinedev/antd` package. As we can see above, it returns us a `tableProps` object:

```tsx
const { tableProps } = useTable<TUser>();
```

`useTable()` is built on top of **Refine** core's [`useMany()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/hooks/use-many/) data hook. `useMany()`, in turn, invokes the [`getMany()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/#getmany) data provider method.

Here, we did not need to set any configuration for our API request and the returned response. The `resource.name` was figured by `useTable` from the `resources` prop that was passed to `<Refine />`. It is possible to set options for **sorting**, **filtering**, **pagination**, etc. with an object passed to `useTable()`.

For all the features that come with the `useTable()` hook, visit [the API reference here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/table/useTable/).

The properties of the `tableProps` object produced are intended to be passed to a `<Table />` component, which we'll consider after `<List />`.

### Refine Ant Design `<List />` Component

The [`<List />`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/components/basic-views/list/) component represents a list view. It is a wrapper around the contents of the list. It accepts a number of relevant props and comes with their sensible defaults, such as for `resource` name and `title` of the page.

In our case, we don't have to pass in any prop because **Refine** figures the `resource` name and `title` from the `resources` prop. In other words, the `<List />` component above is conveniently equivalent to this:

```tsx
<List resource="users" title="Users">
  // Content here...
</List>
```

For more on the usage of `<List />`, look into [the details here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/components/basic-views/list/).

### Refine Ant Design `<Table />` Component

[`useTable()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/table/useTable/) hook's `tableProps` is specifically configured to match the props of **Ant Design**'s native `<Table />` component. **Refine** makes `<Table />` available to us with the `@refinedev/antd` module.

Besides passing in the `tableProps` object to `<Table />`, we are required to provide a unique `rowKey` prop to identify each row in the table:

```tsx
<Table {...tableProps} rowKey="id">
  // React nodes here...
</Table>
```

The records inside `tableProps` are placed inside `<Table.Column />`s of a row of the table - one record per row. If you're new to this, feel free to dive into the [**Ant Design** docs for `<Table />`](https://ant.design/components/table).

### Refine Ant Design `<Table.Column />` Children

`<Table.Column />`s represent individual columns in the table. A column header is set by `<Table.Column />`'s `title` prop. The value of a field in a record is set by the `dataIndex` prop. For example, for the following column, `dataIndex="email"` tells our app to fill the `Email` column of a row associated with a particular `record` with the value of the record's `email` property:

```tsx
<Table.Column dataIndex="email" title="Email" />
```

We can also customize what content to render inside a table cell. We'll examine two such instances in the next section on `<CanvasList />` view, which involves an editable table.

## Adding `resources`

We have covered adding CRUD operations on [Day 3](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication) in significant depth. So, here we'll quickly add both `users` and `canvases` resources to `<Refine />` component:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
// ...
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { UserList } from "pages";

return (
  <Refine
    // ...
    //highlight-start
    resources={[
      {
        name: "users",
        list: "/users",
      },
      {
        name: "canvases",
        list: "/canvases",
      },
    ]}
    //highlight-end
  />
);
```

## Adding routes

After adding resources we need to create routes for them. For the routes, we'll use the `<UserList/>` and `<CanvasList/>` components we created earlier.

[Refer to the CRUD Pages tutorial for more information. →](/core/docs/ui-integrations/ant-design/introduction/)

```tsx title="App.tsx"
// ...

import { Authenticated, CanAccess, Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { ErrorComponent, ThemedLayout } from "@refinedev/antd";
import routerProvider, { NavigateToResource } from "@refinedev/react-router";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

import { CanvasList, UserList } from "./pages";
import { AuthPage } from "./pages/auth";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      {/* ... */}
      <Refine
        // ...
        routerProvider={routerProvider}
      >
        <Routes>
          <Route
            element={
              <Authenticated>
                <ThemedLayout Title={Title}>
                  <CanAccess>
                    <Outlet />
                  </CanAccess>
                </ThemedLayout>
              </Authenticated>
            }
          >
            <Route index element={<NavigateToResource />} />
            <Route path="/users" element={<UserList />} />
            <Route path="/canvases" element={<CanvasList />} />
          </Route>
          <Route
            element={
              <Authenticated fallback={<Outlet />}>
                <NavigateToResource resource="users" />
              </Authenticated>
            }
          >
            <Route
              path="/login"
              element={<AuthPage type="login" registerLink={false} />}
            />
            <Route
              path="/forgot-password"
              element={<AuthPage type="forgotPassword" />}
            />
            <Route
              path="/update-password"
              element={<AuthPage type="updatePassword" />}
            />
          </Route>

          <Route
            element={
              <Authenticated>
                <ThemedLayout>
                  <Outlet />
                </ThemedLayout>
              </Authenticated>
            }
          >
            <Route path="*" element={<ErrorComponent />} />
          </Route>
        </Routes>
        {/* ... */}
      </Refine>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## `<AuthPage />` Customization

At this point, it is helpful that we customize our **Ant Design** theme, the content of the `<AuthPage />` and implement GitHub authentication. We won't cover these here, as they are relatively straight forward and were covered on [Day 3](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication).

Remember, we've already replaced `App.tx` code with the following:

            </Route>
            <Route
              element={
                <Authenticated fallback={<Outlet />}>
                  <NavigateToResource resource="users" />
                </Authenticated>
              }
            >
              <Route

              <Route

                element={<AuthPage type="updatePassword" />}
              />
            </Route>

            <Route
              element={
                <Authenticated>
                  <ThemedLayout>
                    <Outlet />
                  </ThemedLayout>
                </Authenticated>
              }
            >
              <Route path="*" element={<ErrorComponent />} />
            </Route>
          </Routes>
          <UnsavedChangesNotifier />
          <DocumentTitleHandler />
        </Refine>
      </ConfigProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</p>
</details>

Since `authProvider` prop is already passed in by default, after we added the above resources and granted we are connected to the Internet, we will be redirected to the login page:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/login.jpg"  alt="Admin login page" />

<br />

From the `/login` route, logging in should work perfectly with an account already created with the **Pixels** client app. If we log in, we should be directed to `/users` - the default root route of the admin app.

The `name: "users"` property in our first resource is used to define the `/users` route, and `list: UserList` property specifies that `<UserList />` component should be rendered at `/users`.

:::note

Since we are using our example Supabase backend, we will see the following users list.

If you wish to use our example Supabase backend, you can do so by using the provided [Supabase credentials](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/examples/pixels-admin/src/utility/supabaseClient.ts).

You can log into the application with the following account:

```
email: demo@refine.dev
password: demodemo
```

## Editable Table Using Refine and Ant Design

For our `<CanvasList />` view, we want to allow **editors** and **admins** to promote or delete a `canvas` item. This means, we need to be able to send `POST`, `PUT`/`PATCH` and `DELETE` requests. `@refinedev/antd`'s `useEditableTable()` hook makes life beautiful for us.

We have a `useEditableTable()` hook in action inside our `<CanvasList />` component:

<details>
<summary>CanvasList code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="pages/canvases/list.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import { useUpdate } from "@refinedev/core";
import {
  List,
  useEditableTable,
  useModal,
  DeleteButton,
} from "@refinedev/antd";
import { Table, Form, Button, Space, Tag, Modal, Avatar } from "antd";

import { TCanvas } from "../../types/canvas";
import { LogList } from "../../components/logs";
import { CanvasItem } from "../../components/canvas";

type TCanvasPromoteResult = {
  id: number;
  featured: boolean;
};

export const CanvasList = () => {
  const [currentCanvas, setCurrentCanvas] = useState({});
  const { modalProps, show, close } = useModal();
  const { tableProps, formProps } = useEditableTable<TCanvas>({
    liveMode: "auto",
    sorters: {
      initial: [
        {
          field: "created_at",
          order: "desc",
        },
      ],
    },
    meta: {
      select: "*, pixels(id, canvas_id, user_id, x, y, color)",
    },
  });
  const { mutate } = useUpdate<TCanvasPromoteResult>();

  return (
    <List>
      <Form {...formProps}>
        <Table {...tableProps} rowKey="id">
          <Table.Column<TCanvas>

### Refine Ant Design `useEditableTable()` Hook

The `useEditableTable()` hook is the extension of `@refinedev/antd`'s `useTable()` hook. It returns a `formProps` object that we can pass to `<Form />` components in order to handle form actions, loading and displaying success and error messages.

Like `useTable()`, the `useEditableTable()` hook also returns a `tableProps` object:

```tsx
const { tableProps, formProps } = useEditableTable<TCanvas>();
```

The items of `formProps` object are passed to the `<Form />` component:

```tsx
<Form {...formProps}>// React nodes here...</Form>
```

We can do much more with the `useEditableTable()` hook, like activating editing fields when a row is clicked . Here's the elaborate [documentation for `useEditableTable()`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/hooks/table/useEditableTable/)

### Refine Ant Design `<DeleteButton />`

Thanks to the `formProps` being passed to `<Form />`, implementing `delete` action becomes a piece of cake:

```tsx
<DeleteButton size="small" recordItemId={record.id} />
```

`@refinedev/antd`'s `<DeleteButton />` leverages **Ant Design**'s `<Button />` and `<Popconfirm />` components. It invokes the `delete()` data provider method to send a `DELETE` request to the `resource` end point. The `resource.name` is inferred from the `formProps` passed to `<Form />` component.

For more details, visit the [`<DeleteButton />` docs.](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/antd/components/buttons/delete-button/)

### `<Table.Column />`'s `render` Prop

We can customize the content inside our table cell by passing a function to the `render` prop of `<Table.Column />`. In our example, we have a conditional rendering, where the component being rendered depends on `record.is_featured`:

```tsx
<Table.Column<TCanvas>
  key="is_featured"
  dataIndex="is_featured"
  title={<h4 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Featured</h4>}
  render={(_, record) =>
    record.is_featured ? (
      <Tag
        color="success"
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
        }}
      >
        Yes
      </Tag>
    ) : (
      <Tag
        color="warning"
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
        }}
      >
        No
      </Tag>
    )
  }
/>
```

We also grouped content inside a cell, with `<Button />` and `<DeleteButton />` being sibling flex items:

```tsx
<Table.Column<TCanvas>
  title={<h4 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Actions</h4>}
  dataIndex="actions"
  render={(_, record) => (
    <Space style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
      <Button
        size="small"
        style={{ width: "100px" }}
        type={record.is_featured ? "ghost" : "primary"}
        onClick={() =>
          mutate({
            resource: "canvases",
            id: record.id,
            values: {
              is_featured: !record.is_featured,
            },
            meta: {
              canvas: record,
            },
          })
        }
      >
        {record.is_featured ? "Unpromote" : "Promote"}
      </Button>
      <DeleteButton size="small" recordItemId={record.id} />
    </Space>
  )}
/>
```

## Adding `<CanvasList>` to the `resources`

We have covered adding CRUD operations on [Day 3](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication) in significant depth. So, here we'll quickly add `canvases` resources to `<Refine />` component:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { CanvasList } from "pages";
...

return (
  <Refine
    ...
    authProvider={authProvider}
    // highlight-start
    resources={[
      {
          name: "canvases",
          list: "/canvases",
        },
    ]}
    // highlight-end
  />
)
```

With these additions, `/canvases` looks like this:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/canvas-list.jpg"  alt="Canvases list table" />

<br />

## Summary

In this post, we initialized an admin dashboard app for our **Pixels** client app which we built in the previous episodes in the [RefineWeek](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine/) series. We implemented list views for two `resources`: `users` and `canvases`.

Inside the lists, we fetched data from these resources and rendered them inside tables. We implemented two types of tables using two distinct `@refinedev/antd` hooks: `useTable()` for regular tables and `useEditableTable()` that allows data in the table to be mutated.

These hooks are supported by **Refine** core's `useMany()` hook, which uses the `getMany()` data provider method to interact with external API.

In the UI side, these hooks automatically make available appropriate props to be passed to `<Table />` and `<Form />` components.

In the next post, we will focus on implementing Role Based Access Control to our dashboard based on `editor` and `admin` roles.

---

## Part 6: Implementing Role Based Access Control

In this post, we implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) on our **Pixels Admin** app. **Pixels Admin** serves as the admin dashboard of our **Pixels** client app that we built previously in the [**RefineWeek**](https://refine.dev/core/week-of-refine/) series.

This is Day 6, and **RefineWeek** is a seven-part tutorial that aims to help developers learn the ins-and-outs of [**Refine**'](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)s powerful capabilities and get going with **Refine** within a week.

## Overview

On Day 5, we implemented CRUD functionalities on our dashboard resources: `users` and `canvases`.

Taking it farther today, we add authorization for actions related to `canvases` resource at `/canvases` route. We have have two roles that seek authorization: `editor` and `admin`. An `editor` is allowed to only promote and unpromote a `canvas`, whereas an `admin` is free to promote / unpromote a `canvas` as well as delete it. Here's a short description of the specs:

1. `editor` can promote and unpromote a canvas.
2. `editor` cannot perform any other action.
3. `admin` can promote and unpromote a canvas.
4. `admin` can delete a canvas.
5. `admin` cannot perform any other action.

We manage RBAC and authorization using [**Casbin**](https://casbin.org/docs/overview) models and policies. We then make use of **Refine**'s `accessControlProvider` and associated hooks to enforce policies for these roles.

For the backend, we set and store `user` roles with the help of **Supabase Custom Claims**. **Supabase Custom Claims** are a handy mechanism to store user roles information on the `auth.users` table.

We also dig into some low level code in the `<DeleteButton />` component that **Refine**'s **Ant Design** package gives us to see how authorization comes baked into some of the related components.

Let's start with **Casbin**.

## Casbin with **Refine**

In this app, we are implementing Role Based Access Control model with **Casbin** so we assume you are at least familiar with the RBAC related models and policies.

If you are not familiar with **Casbin**, please feel free to go through [how it works](https://casbin.org/docs/how-it-works). For a complete beginner, I recommend understanding the following sections in the **Casbin** docs:

1. [Get Started](https://casbin.org/docs/get-started)
2. [How It Works](https://casbin.org/docs/how-it-works)
3. [Supported Models](https://casbin.org/docs/supported-models)
4. [Syntax for Models](https://casbin.org/docs/syntax-for-models)
5. [Model Storage](https://casbin.org/docs/model-storage)
6. [Policy Storage](https://casbin.org/docs/policy-storage)
7. [Enforcers](https://casbin.org/docs/enforcers)
8. [Adapters](https://casbin.org/docs/adapters)
9. [Role Managers](https://casbin.org/docs/role-managers)
10. [RBAC](https://casbin.org/docs/rbac)

If / when you are familiar, lovely yay! Be with me, go ahead and install **Casbin**:

### Casbin Installation

```bash
npm install casbin
```

#### Browser Fallbacks for Casbin

We need to configure polyfills for `vite` to work in a browser environment.

Let's first install required packages:

```node
npm install -D rollup-plugin-polyfill-node @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill @esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill
```

After that we need to add the following to the `vite.config.ts` file:

```tsx title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

import { NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill";
import { NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill";
import rollupNodePolyFill from "rollup-plugin-polyfill-node";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      // Node.js global to browser globalThis
      define: {
        global: "globalThis",
      },
      // Enable esbuild polyfill plugins
      plugins: [
        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
        // @ts-ignore
        NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin({
          buffer: true,
          process: true,
        }),
        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
        // @ts-ignore
        NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin(),
      ],
    },
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      plugins: [rollupNodePolyFill()],
    },
  },
});
```

Without these overrides, `casbin` versions `>5` is known to throw errors.

With this out of the way and the **Casbin** model policies ready, it's time for us to define the `accessControlProvider`.

### Casbin Model and Policies

We are using the following `model` and policy `adapter` for our RBAC implementation:

```tsx title="src/casbin/accessControl.ts"
import { newModel, StringAdapter } from "casbin";

export const model = newModel(`
  [request_definition]
  r = sub, obj, act

  [policy_definition]
  p = sub, obj, act

  [role_definition]
  g = _, _

  [policy_effect]
  e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

  [matchers]
  m = g(r.sub, p.sub) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && regexMatch(r.act, p.act)
`);

export const adapter = new StringAdapter(`
  p, admin, users, list
  p, admin, canvases, (list)|(edit)|(delete)

  p, editor, users, list
  p, editor, canvases, (list)|(edit)
`);
```

A quick run down of the `model` is:

- with the request definition in `r = sub, obj, act`, **Casbin** scans the request for the subject (`editor` or `admin`), object (the `resource`) and the action (`get`, `create`, `edit`, etc.).
- with the same parameters in `p = sub, obj, act`, it compares the request parameters with those in the policy instances declared in the policy adapter
- with the two level grouping in `g = _, _`, we are declaring user role inheritance can go two levels deep, i.e. an `admin` is an `user`.

The `adapter` holds our instances of policies produced from `p`. The policies above basically allows:

- an `admin` to `list` users.
- an admin to `list`, `edit` and `delete` canvases.
- an `editor` to `list` users.
- an `editor` to `list` and `edit` canvases.

## `<Refine />`'s `accessControlProvider`

`<Refine />`'s `accessControlProvider` is responsible for enforcing authorization on every request sent from the app. If we look at the `<App />` component, we can see that it comes passed to the `<Refine />` component with the boilerplate code:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
...
<Refine
	accessControlProvider={accessControlProvider}
/>
...
```

### **Refine** `can` Method

The `accessControlProvider` implements only one method named `can`. It has the following type signature:

```tsx
type CanParams = {
  resource: string;
  action: string;
  params?: {
    resource?: IResourceItem;
    id?: BaseKey;
    [key: string]: any;
  };
};
```

Let's now work on the `can` method. We can see from the type definition that `resource` and `action` are compulsory.

Basic implementation of `can` method looks like this:

[Refer to the Access Control Provider documentation for more information. → ](/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/accessControl-provider/)

```tsx title="src/providers/accessControlProvider.ts"
import { newEnforcer } from "casbin";
import { CanParams, CanReturnType } from "@refinedev/core";
import { adapter, model } from "../casbin/accessControl";

export const accessControlProvider = {
  can: async ({ resource, action }: CanParams): Promise<CanReturnType> => {
    const enforcer = await newEnforcer(model, adapter);
    const can = await enforcer.enforce("admin", resource, action);

    return Promise.resolve({
      can,
    });
  },
};
```

We will modify this gradually to witness the functionality facilitated out-of-the-box by **Refine** for each role defined in the policies. We will finalize it after we update the `getPermissions()` method in **Supabase** `authProvider`.

But for now, notice in the above definition that we are passing the compulsory `resource` and `action` parameters to `can`. We expect the `useCan()` access control hook to take these two arguments.

For more use cases and implementations of `can`, feel free to go through the elaborate examples in [this definitive and guiding post](https://refine.dev/core/docs/advanced-tutorials/access-control/).

In the above code, we are initializing a **Casbin** `Enforcer` with the `model` and `adapter`. We want this `enforcer` to enforce the policies with its accepted arguments. At the end, we get the `Boolean` decision based on the model's policy effect.

From inside a component, the `accessControlProvider.can` method will be invoked via the [`useCan()` hook](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/hooks/accessControl/useCan/).

With this code now, there should be no change in our UI. That is, we should be able to view the contents of both our `/users` and `/canvases` resources like they were before. When we visit the `/canvases` route, we should have all the buttons displayed.

We expect this behavior to change when we change the role. In the `can` method above let's set the first argument of `enforcer.enforce()` to `"editor"`:

```tsx
const can = await enforcer.enforce("editor", resource, action);
```

And if we refresh at `/canvases`, we can see that the `Delete` button on each row gets disabled.

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/can-access-disabled.jpg"  alt="Delete buttons disabled for editor role" />

<br />

This is because now our policy for `editor` has taken effect.

The `Delete` button gets disabled because `@refinedev/antd`'s special buttons like the `<DeleteButton />` are enabled or disabled based on the result of access control enforcement. Our `editor` policies do not allow a `delete` action on `canvases` resource, so the `Delete` button is disabled.

Visit [this section](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/accessControl-provider/#buttons) of the [`accessControlProvider` API reference](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/accessControl-provider/) for the complete list of buttons that check for and depend on user authorization state in **Refine**.

At this point, we have manipulated the role with changes in our code. This should, however, come from the `authProvider`'s `getPermissions()` method.

So, let's look how to get the roles from our **Supabase** database next.

## User Permissions with Supabase in Refine

In **Refine**, user roles are fetched by `authProvider`'s `getPermissions()` method. It is already defined for us by `@refinedev/supabase`.

When you bootstraped **Refine** app with CLI, the default `getPermissions` method in `authProvider` looks like below:

```tsx title="src/providers/authProvider.ts"
getPermissions: async () => {
  const user = await supabaseClient.auth.getUser();

  if (user) {
    return user.data.user?.role;
  }

  return null;
};
```

However, **Supabase** in itself does not support **setting** user roles to `users` in the `auth.users` table. So, it is not possible to set `editor` and `admin` roles we need for our designated users. And only two role options are available to the front end app: `authenticated` and `anon`.

So, before we can use the `getPermissions()` method, we have to set up custom user roles. One way to implement this is with [**Supabase Custom Claims**](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims).

### Setting Up User Roles with Supabase Custom Claims

**Supabase Custom Claims** is a community contribution that enables setting additional data to the access token that a user receives from **Supabase**. These claims are stored in the `auth.users.raw_app_meta_data` field and is sent to the client with the access token. We are going to use these custom claims to set and retrieve user roles for our app.

**Supabase** does not support custom claims on its own. Due credits to [@burggraf](https://github.com/burggraf), they are enabled by installing a number of functions on our database. These functions allow us to set and get custom claims for a particular user in the `auth.users` table.

Here are two crucial particulars on how they work:

- Only a user with a `{ claims_admin: true }` claim can set claims data on others. So we need to bootstrap a `claims_admin` role for a first user using the **Supabase** SQL Editor.
- Our app can access the getter and setter functions via **Supabase** Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) with the `supabaseClient.rpc()` method.

With these in mind, let's go ahead and set up **Supabase Custom Claims** on our database.

**Installing Custom Claims Functions**

Let's start with installing the custom claims SQL functions. Copy, paste and run the [install.sql](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims/blob/main/install.sql) script in your **Supabase** SQL Editor.

Take a note of the function named `get_my_claims()`:

```sql title="https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims/blob/main/install.sql"
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_my_claims() RETURNS "jsonb"
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE
    AS $$
  select
  	coalesce(nullif(current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true), '')::jsonb -> 'app_metadata', '{}'::jsonb)::jsonb
```

This SQL function will help us to remotely get user roles for our app. And we are going to call it from our `getPermissions()` method. To understand the details, please read through the [**Supabhase Custom Claims** page](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims#getting-claims-data-from-the-server).
<br />

**Bootstrapping Claims Admin Role**

We then have to bootstrap a `claims_admin` role because only users with `{ claims_admin: true }` can set claims data for other users. This is necessary for security of the claims admin feature, and not for our app code. So, in the **Supabase** SQL Editor run the following query:

```sql
select set_claim('designated-user-uuid', 'claims_admin', 'true');
```

This will allow the user with id `designated-user-uuid` to set roles for other users from inside our app.

We can also set other data from the SQL Editor, such as the role itself. Let's use the following SQL query to set roles for some of our designated users. Doing so will help us in the coming sections:

```sql
select set_claim('designated-user-uuid', 'role', '"editor"');
select set_claim('another-designated-user-uuid', 'role', '"admin"');
```

We need to take special care about using the correct quotations. More on this [in this section](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-custom-claims#set_claimuid-uuid-claim-text-value-jsonb-returns-text).

With these done, we are ready to update our `getPermissions()` and `can` methods.

### **Refine** `getPermissions()` with Supabase Custom Claims

Here's the adjusted `getPermissions()` method:

```tsx title="providers/dataProvider.ts"
getPermissions: async () => {
    try {
        const { error } = await supabaseClient.auth.getUser();

        if (error) {
            console.error(error);
            return;
        }

        const { data } = await supabaseClient.rpc("get_my_claim", {
            claim: "role",
        });

        return data;
    } catch (error: any) {
        console.error(error);
        return;
    }
},
```

Here, we are basically using the `supabaseClient.rpc()` method to call the `get_my_claims` SQL function remotely.

## Refine `can` Method for Supabase Custom Roles

And now, we can finalize our `can` method with `role` received from `authProvider.getPermissions()`:

```tsx title="providers/accessControlProvider.ts"
import { newEnforcer } from "casbin";
import { CanParams, CanReturnType } from "@refinedev/core";

import { adapter, model } from "../casbin/accessControl";
import { authProvider } from "./authProvider";

export const accessControlProvider = {
  can: async ({ resource, action }: CanParams): Promise<CanReturnType> => {
    const role = await authProvider.getPermissions?.();

    const enforcer = await newEnforcer(model, adapter);
    const can = await enforcer.enforce(role, resource, action);

    return Promise.resolve({
      can,
    });
  },
};
```

Earlier on, we have set `admin` and `editor` roles for a few designated users using the **Supabase** SQL Editor. Now, logging into their respective accounts will display the dashboard with **Casbin** policies applied.

In the `/canvases` route, an `editor` account should have the `Delete` buttons disabled because we don't have it in our policies.

In contrast, it is enabled for an `admin` role:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/can-access-enabled.jpg"  alt="Delete buttons enabled for admin role" />

<br />

But, wait! We haven't used the `useCan()` hook or the `<CanAccess />` component anywhere yet. How does **Refine** get the value of `role` to decide whether to enable or disable the button? Let's find out next!

## Low Level Inspection

If we dig into the `@refinedev/antd` package for the `<DeleteButton />` component, we can see that `useCan()` hook is used to decide the authorization status:

```tsx title="node_modules/@refinedev/antd/src/components/buttons/delete/index.ts"
export const DeleteButton: React.FC<DeleteButtonProps> = ({
	...
}) => {
	...

	const { data } = useCan({
		resource: resourceName,
		action: "delete",
		params: { id, resource },
		queryOptions: {
				enabled: accessControlEnabled,
		},
	});

	if (accessControlEnabled && hideIfUnauthorized && !data?.can) {
		return null;
	}

	...
};
```

Since authorization comes baked in with `<DeleteButton />`, we didn't have to worry about it in our case.

## Summary

In this post, we implemented Role Based Access Control on `users` and `canvases` resources using **Refine**'s `accessControlProvider` in our **Pixels Admin** app.

We used **Casbin** model and policies to enforce authorization for `editor` and `admin` roles. We saw how the `accessControlProvider.can` method is used to enforce **Casbin** policies based on roles fetched from the backend using the `authProvider.getPermissions` method. We also learned how **refine-antd** buttons like the `<DeleteButton />` implements access control via the `useCan()` access hook.

In the next episode, we will explore the `auditLogProvider` prop and add audit logging for `pixels` activities to both our **Pixels** and **Pixels Admin** apps.

---

## Part 7: Audit Log With Refine

In this post, we apply **Refine**'s built-in audit logging functionality to our **Pixels Admin** app and to the **Pixels** client app that we built previously in this [**RefineWeek**](http://localhost:3000/week-of-refine/) series. **Refine**'s audit logging system comes already baked into its data hooks and inside supplemental data provider packages, like the [`@refinedev/supabase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@refinedev/supabase). Today we are going to get it to work by using the `auditLogProvider` prop.

This is Day 7, and **RefineWeek** is a quickfire tutorial guide that aims to help developers learn the ins-and-outs of **Refine**'s powerful capabilities and get going with **Refine** within a week.

## Overview

In this series, we have been exploring **Refine**'s internals by building two apps: the **Pixels** client that allows users to create and collboratively draw on a canvas, and the **Pixels Admin** app that allows admins and editors to manage canvases created by users.

We implemented CRUD actions for **Pixels** client app on [Day 3](#part-3-adding-crud-actions-and-authentication) and for the admin app on [Day 5](#part-5-creating-an-admin-dashboard-with-refine). In this episode, we enable audit logging on database mutations by defining the `auditLogProvider` object and passing it to `<Refine />`.

We are using **Refine**'s supplemental [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) `@refinedev/supabase` package for our `dataProvider` client. The database mutation methods in **Supabase** `dataProvider` already come with audit logging mechanism implemented on them. For each successful database mutation, i.e. `create`, `update` and `delete` actions, a log event is emitted and a `params` object representing the change is made available to the `auditLogProvider.create()` method.

We will store the log entries in a `logs` table in our **Supabase** database. So, we have to set up the `logs` table with a shape that complies with the `params` object sent from the mutation.

We will start by examining the shape of the `params` object and specifying how the `logs` table should look like - before we go ahead and create the table with appropriate columns from our **Supabase** dashboard. We will then work on the `auditLogProvider` methods, and use the `useLogList()` hook to list `pixels` logs inside a modal for each canvas item. Finally, like we did in other parts, we will dig into the existing code to explore how **Refine** emits a log event and how mutation methods implement audit logging under the hood.

Let's dive in!

## `logs` Table for **Refine** Audit Logs

We need to set up the `logs` table from the **Supabase** dashboard. But let's first figure out the columns we need for the table. The table should have as columns the properties of the log `params` object emitted by a mutation.

### **Refine**'s Log Params Object

A successful resource `create` action makes the following log `params` object available to the `auditLogProvider.create()` method:

```tsx
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "pixels",
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "x": "3",
    "y": "3",
    "color": "cyan",
  },
  "meta": {
    "dataProviderName": "Google",
    "id": "1"
  }
}
```

This object should be passed to the audit log provider's `create` method in order to create a new record in the `logs` table.

Likewise, the `update` and `delete` actions of a resource - for example, `pixels` - emit an object with similar, overlapping variations. More on that [here](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/audit-log-provider/#create).

It is important **_not_** to confuse a resource `create` action with that of the `auditLogProvider`. The resource `create` action is carried out by the `dataProvider.create()` method and produces the log `params` object. The `auditLogProvider.create()` method consumes the `params` object and creates an entry in the `logs` table.

For our case, we are focused on logging the `pixels` `create` actions on a canvas in our **Pixels** client app.

### The `meta` Object

Notice, the `meta.id` property on the log `params` object above. It represents the `id` of the **resource item** on which the event was created.

It is possible to append useful data to the `meta` field by passing the data to the `meta` object when the mutation is invoked from a hook. For example, we can add the `canvas` property to the `meta` object inside the argument passed to the `mutate` function of the `useCreate()` hook:

```tsx
const { mutate } = useCreate();

mutate({
  resource: "pixels",
  values: { x, y, color, canvas_id: canvas?.id, user_id: identity.id },
  meta: {
    canvas,
  },
});
```

And it will be included in the log `params` object's `meta` field:

```tsx
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "pixels",
  "author": {
    "id": ""
    // ...other_properties
  },
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "x": "3",
    "y": "3",
    "color": "cyan",
  },
  "meta": {
    "dataProviderName": "Google",
    "id": "1",
    "canvas": {
      "id": "",
      // ...etc.
    },
  }
}
```

Properties inside the `meta` object are handy for filtering `get` requests to the `logs` table. We are going to use this when we define the `auditLogProvider.get()` method.

Notice also the `author` property. It is added when a user is authenticated. Otherwise, it is excluded.

### The `logs` Table

Emanating from the log params object above, our `logs` table looks like this:

<div className="centered-image"  >
  <img style={{alignSelf:"center"}}  src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog%2F2023-02-20-refine-pixels-7%2Fdiagram.png"  alt="Audit log flow diagram" />
</div>

<br/>

Let's go ahead and create this table from our **Supabase** dashboard before we move forward and start working on the `auditLogProvider` methods.

## `<Refine />`'s `auditLogProvider` Object

`<Refine />`'s audit log provider object should have three methods. It has the following type signature:

```tsx
const auditLogProvider = {
  create: (params: {
    resource: string;
    action: string;
    data?: any;
    author?: {
      name?: string;
      [key: string]: any;
    };
    previousData?: any;
    meta?: Record<string, any>;
  }) => void;
  get: (params: {
    resource: string;
    action?: string;
    meta?: Record<string, any>;
    author?: Record<string, any>;
    meta?: MetaDataQuery;
  }) => Promise<any>;
  update: (params: {
    id: BaseKey;
    name: string;
  }) => Promise<any>;
};
```

Based on this, our `auditLogProvider` looks like this:

```tsx title="providers/auditLogProvider.ts"
import { AuditLogProvider } from "@refinedev/core";
import { dataProvider } from "@refinedev/supabase";

import { supabaseClient } from "../utility";

export const auditLogProvider: AuditLogProvider = {
  get: async ({ resource, meta }) => {
    const { data } = await dataProvider(supabaseClient).getList({
      resource: "logs",
      filters: [
        {
          field: "resource",
          operator: "eq",
          value: resource,
        },
        {
          field: "meta->canvas->id",
          operator: "eq",
          value: `"${meta?.canvas?.id}"`,
        },
      ],
      sort: [{ order: "desc", field: "created_at" }],
    });

    return data;
  },
  create: (params) => {
    return dataProvider(supabaseClient).create({
      resource: "logs",
      variables: params,
    });
  },
  update: async ({ id, name }) => {
    const { data } = await dataProvider(supabaseClient).update({
      resource: "logs",
      id,
      variables: { name },
    });

    return data;
  },
};
```

We'll analyze all three methods in the below sections.

### `create`

The `create` method is very straightforward. It just takes the log `params` object sent when the log event was emitted, and adds an entry to the `logs` table.

It is called when any of the three mutation actions, namely `create`, `update` and `delete` is completed successfully.

### `update`

The `update` method is similar. Our implementation allows updating the `name` of the log item. Hence we need to add a `name` column in our database. If you haven't already noticed it, we have a `name` column in our `logs` table and this is the reason. The `update` methods queries the database with the `id` of the log entry and allows updating its `name`. More information is available in [this section](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/audit-log-provider/#update).

### `get`

The `get` method is the most significant of the three, especially with the use of the `meta` argument. What we're doing first is using the `dataProvider.getList()` method to query the `logs` table.

Then inside the `filters` array, we're first filtering `log` records with the `resource` field and then with the nested embedded field of `meta->canvas->id`. As we will encounter in the next section, the `canvas` property will be appended to the `meta` field of the log `params` object. It will be done by passing the `canvas` to the `meta` object of the argument passed to the mutation method of `useCreate()` data hook. It will therefore be stored in the `log` record.

When we want to query the `logs` table, we will use the `useLogList()` audit log hook that consumes the `get()` method. The `meta?.canvas?.id` comes from the `meta` argument passed to `useLogList()`.

With this done, we are ready to log all `pixels` creations and show the `pixels` log list for each of our canvases.

## Audit Logging with **Refine**

In order to enable audit logging feature in our app, we have to first pass the `auditLogProvider` prop to `<Refine />`. Since `pixels` are being created in the **Pixels** app, that's where we are going to implement it:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
<Refine
  ...
  auditLogProvider={auditLogProvider}
/>
```

This makes all database mutations emit a log event and send the log `params` object towards the `auditLogProvider.create()` method. Mutations that emit an event are `create()`, `update()` and `delete()` methods of the `dataProvider` object.

When these methods are consumed from components using corresponding hooks, and given the `logs` table is set up properly, a successful mutation creates an entry in the `logs` table.

### Audit Log `create` Action

In the **Pixels** app, `pixels` are created by the `onSubmit()` event handler defined inside the `<CanvasShow />` component. The `<CanvasShow />` component looks like this:

<details>
<summary>Show CanvasShow code</summary>
<p>

```tsx title="pages/canvases/show.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import {
  useCreate,
  useGetIdentity,
  useNavigation,
  useShow,
  useParsed,
  useIsAuthenticated,
} from "@refinedev/core";
import { useModal } from "@refinedev/antd";

import { LeftOutlined } from "@ant-design/icons";
import { Button, Typography, Spin, Modal } from "antd";

import { CanvasItem, DisplayCanvas } from "../../components/canvas";
import { ColorSelect } from "../../components/color-select";
import { AvatarPanel } from "../../components/avatar";
import { colors } from "../../utility";
import { Canvas } from "../../types";
import { LogList } from "../../components/logs";

const { Title } = Typography;

type Colors = typeof colors;

export const CanvasShow: React.FC = () => {
  const { pathname } = useParsed();
  const [color, setColor] = useState<Colors[number]>("black");
  const { modalProps, show, close } = useModal();
  const { data: identity } = useGetIdentity<any>();
  const { data: { authenticated } = {} } = useIsAuthenticated();

  const {
    query: { data: { data: canvas } = {} },
  } = useShow<Canvas>();
  const { mutate } = useCreate();
  const { list, push } = useNavigation();

  const onSubmit = (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!authenticated) {
      if (pathname) {
        return push(`/login?to=${encodeURIComponent(pathname)}`);
      }

      return push(`/login`);
    }

    if (typeof x === "number" && typeof y === "number" && canvas?.id) {
      mutate({
        resource: "pixels",
        values: {
          x,
          y,
          color,
          canvas_id: canvas?.id,
          user_id: identity.id,
        },
        meta: {
          canvas,
        },
        successNotification: false,
      });
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="paper">
        <div className="paper-header">
          <Button
            type="text"
            onClick={() => list("canvases")}
            style={{ textTransform: "uppercase" }}
          >
            <LeftOutlined />
            Back
          </Button>
          <Title level={3}>{canvas?.name ?? canvas?.id ?? ""}</Title>
          <Button type="primary" onClick={show}>
            View Changes
          </Button>
        </div>
        <Modal
          title="Canvas Changes"
          {...modalProps}
          centered
          destroyOnClose
          onOk={close}
          onCancel={() => {
            close();
          }}
          footer={[
            <Button type="primary" key="close" onClick={close}>
              Close
            </Button>,
          ]}
        >
          <LogList currentCanvas={canvas} />
        </Modal>

        {canvas ? (
          <DisplayCanvas canvas={canvas}>
            {(pixels) =>
              pixels ? (
                <div
                  style={{
                    display: "flex",
                    justifyContent: "center",
                    gap: 48,
                  }}
                >
                  <div>
                    <ColorSelect selected={color} onChange={setColor} />
                  </div>
                  <CanvasItem
                    canvas={canvas}
                    pixels={pixels}
                    onPixelClick={onSubmit}
                    scale={(20 / (canvas?.width ?? 20)) * 2}
                    active={true}
                  />
                  <div style={{ width: 120 }}>
                    <AvatarPanel pixels={pixels} />
                  </div>
                </div>
              ) : (
                <div className="spin-wrapper">
                  <Spin />
                </div>
              )
            }
          </DisplayCanvas>
        ) : (
          <div className="spin-wrapper">
            <Spin />
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</p>
</details>

The `mutate()` function being invoked inside `onSubmit()` handler is destrcutured from the `useCreate()` hook. We know that audit logging has been activated for the `useCreate()` hooks, so a successful `pixels` creation sends the `params` object to `auditLogProvider.create` method.

Notice that we are passing the `currentCanvas` as `meta.canvas`, which we expect to be populated inside the `meta` property of the log `params` object. As we'll see below, we are going to use it to filter our `GET` request to the `logs` table using `useLogList()` hook.

### Audit Log List with **Refine**

We are going to display the `pixels` log list for a canvas in the `<LogList />` component. In the **Pixels** app, it is contained in the `<CanvasShow />` page and housed inside a modal accessible by clicking on the `View Changes` button. The `<LogList />` component uses the `useLogList()` hook to query the `logs` table:

```tsx title="components/logs/list.tsx"
import { useLogList } from "@refinedev/core";
import { Avatar, List, Typography } from "antd";

import { formattedDate, timeFromNow } from "../../utility/time";

type TLogListProps = {
  currentCanvas: any;
};

export const LogList = ({ currentCanvas }: TLogListProps) => {
  const { data } = useLogList({
    resource: "pixels",
    meta: {
      canvas: currentCanvas,
    },
  });

  return (
    <List
      size="small"
      dataSource={data}
      renderItem={(item: any) => (
        <List.Item>
          <List.Item.Meta
            avatar={
              <Avatar src={item?.author?.user_metadata?.avatar_url} size={20} />
            }
          />
          <Typography.Text style={{ fontSize: "12px" }}>
            <strong>{item?.author?.user_metadata?.email}</strong>
            {` ${item.action}d a pixel on canvas: `}
            <strong>{`${item?.meta?.canvas?.name} `}</strong>
            <span style={{ fontSize: "10px", color: "#9c9c9c" }}>
              {`${formattedDate(item.created_at)} - ${timeFromNow(
                item.created_at,
              )}`}
            </span>
          </Typography.Text>
        </List.Item>
      )}
    />
  );
};
```

If we examine closely, the `meta` property of the argument object passed to `useLogList()` hook contains the `canvas` against which we want to filter the `logs` table. If we revisit the `auditLogProvider.create` method, we can see that the `value` field of the second filter corresponds to this canvas:

```tsx
{
  field: "meta->canvas->id",
  operator: "eq",
  value: `"${meta?.canvas?.id}"`,
}
```

We are doing this to make sure that we are getting only the logs for the current canvas.

With this completed, if we ask for the modal in the `CanvasShow` page, we should be able to see the pixels log list:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/client-audit-log.jpg"  alt="Client audit log table" />

<br />

We don't have a case for creating a pixel in the **Pixels Admin** app. But we can go ahead and implement the same pixels `<LogList />` component for each `canvas` item in the `<CanvasList />` page at `/canvases`. The code is essentially the same, but the `View Changes` button appears inside each row in the table:

<img src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/2023-02-18-refine-pixels-5/admin-audit-log.jpg"  alt="Admin audit log table" />

<br />

## Low Level Inspection

We are now going to examine how audit logging comes built-in inside **Refine**'s mutation hooks.

### Log `params` Object

We mentioned earlier that each successful mutation emits a log event and sends a `params` object to the `auditLogProvider.create()` method. Let's dig into the code to see how it is done.

The log `params` object is sent to the `auditLogProvider.create()` method from inside the `log` object returned from the `useLog()` hook:

```tsx title="@refinedev/core/src/hooks/auditLog/useLog/index.ts"
// v4.5.8
const log = useMutation<TLogData, Error, LogParams, unknown>(async (params) => {
  const resource = resources.find((p) => p.name === params.resource);
  const logPermissions = resource?.options?.auditLog?.permissions;

  if (logPermissions) {
    if (!hasPermission(logPermissions, params.action)) {
      return;
    }
  }

  let authorData;
  if (isLoading) {
    authorData = await refetch();
  }

  return await auditLogContext.create?.({
    ...params,
    author: identityData ?? authorData?.data,
  });
});
```

As we can see above, `params` is made available by reaching the provider via the `auditLogContext.create()` method.

Prior to that, the `log` object here utilizes `react-query`'s `useMutation()` hook to catch the results of the mutation with an observer and emit the event.

### Inside Mutation Hooks

Inside mutation hooks, the `useLog()` hook is used to create a log automatically after a successful resource mutation. For example, the `useCreate()` data hook implements it with the `mutate` method on `log` object returned from `useLog()`:

```tsx title="@refinedev/core/src/data/hooks/useCreate.ts"
// v4.5.8

log?.mutate({
  action: "create",
  resource,
  data: values,
  meta: {
    dataProviderName: pickDataProvider(resource, dataProviderName, resources),
    id: data?.data?.id ?? undefined,
    ...rest,
  },
});
```

The code snippets above are enough to give us a peek inside what is going, but feel free to explore the entire files for more insight.

## Summary

In this episode, we activated **Refine**'s built-in audit logging feature by defining and passing the `auditLogProvider`prop to `<Refine />`. We we learned that **Refine** implements audit logging from its resource mutation hooks by sending a log `params` object to the `auditProvider.create()` method, and when audit logging is activated, every successful mutation creates an entry in the `logs` table.

We implemented audit logging for `create` actions of the `pixels` resource in our **Pixels** app and saved the entries in a `logs` table in our **Supabase** database. We then fetched the pixel creation logs for each canvas using the `useLoglist()` hook and displayed the in a modal. We leverage the `meta` property of the log `params` object in order to filter our `auditProvider.get()` request.

## Series Wrap Up

In this **RefineWeek** series, built the following two apps with **Refine**:

[**Pixels**](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels) - the client app that allows users to create a canvas and draw collaboratively on
[**Pixels Admin**](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/pixels-admin) - the admin dashboard that helps managers manage users and canvases

While building these twp apps, we have covered core **Refine** concepts like the providers and hooks in significant depth. We had the opportunity to use majority of the providers with the features we added to these apps. Below is the brief outline of the providers we learned about:

- [`authProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/auth-provider/): used to handling authentication. We used it to implement email / password based authentication as well as social logins with Google and GitHub.
- [`dataProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/): used to fetch data to and from a backend API by sending HTTP requests. We used the supplementary **Supabase** package to build a gallery of canvases, a public dashboard and a private dashboard for role based managers.
- [`routerProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/router-provider/): used for routing. We briefly touched over how it handles routing and resources following RESTful conventions.
- [`liveProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/live-provider/): used to implement real time Publish Subscribe features. We used it for allowing users to draw pixels collaboratively on a canvas.
- [`accessControlProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/accessControl-provider/): used to implement authorization. We implemented a Role Based Access Control authorization for `editor` and `admin` roles.
- [`auditLogProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/audit-log-provider/): used for logging resource mutations. We used it to log and display pixels drawing activities on a canvas.
- [`notificationProvider`](https://refine.dev/core/docs/api-reference/core/providers/notification-provider/): used for posting notifications for resource actions. We did not cover it, but used it inside our code.

There are more to **Refine** than what we have covered in this series. We have made great strides in covering these topics so far by going through the documentation, especially to understand the provider - hooks interactions.

We also covered supplementary **Supabase** anhd **Ant Design** packages. **Refine** has fantastic support for **Ant Design** components. And we have seen how **refine-antd** components complement data fetching by the data providers and help readily present the response data with hooks like `useSimpleList()`, `useTable()` and `useEditableTable()`.

We can always build on what we have covered so far. There are plenty of things that we can do moving froward, like customizing the layout, header, auth pages, how exactly the `notificationProvider` works, how to implement the `i18nProvider`, etc.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Refine?

Refine is a React-based framework for building data-heavy CRUD applications like admin panels, dashboards, and internal tools. It provides a headless core with support for multiple UI frameworks including Ant Design, Material UI, Mantine, and Chakra UI.

### Do I need to know Supabase to follow this guide?

Basic familiarity with Supabase helps, but the guide covers all the Supabase setup steps you need. Supabase is used as the backend database and authentication provider throughout the tutorial.

### Can I use a different UI library instead of Ant Design?

Yes. Refine is headless at its core, so you can swap Ant Design for Material UI, Mantine, Chakra UI, or build your own custom UI. The data fetching, authentication, and access control logic remain the same regardless of the UI library.

### How does Refine handle real-time features?

Refine uses a `liveProvider` prop that integrates with Supabase's Realtime servers. Once configured, data hooks like `useList()` automatically subscribe to changes, and mutation hooks like `useCreate()` publish events to the appropriate channels.

### What is Casbin and why is it used in this guide?

Casbin is an authorization library that supports various access control models. In this guide, it is used to implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for the admin dashboard, defining what actions `editor` and `admin` roles can perform.

### Can I deploy these apps to production?

Yes. Both the Pixels client and admin apps are production-ready examples. You would need your own Supabase project with proper credentials and Row Level Security policies configured for a production deployment.
