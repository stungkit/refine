`useUpdateMany` is one of Refine's data hooks. It performs the process of updating more than one data. In this example, we used the `useUpdateMany` hook to edit multiple data on the table. You can edit more than one data by selecting the rows you want to edit on your table. You can get more information by examining the example.
