It is an example of Chakra UI Advanced [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) created with Refine's `@refinedev/react-table` adapter. In addition to the Chakra UI Basic React Table example, deletion editing and filtering features are used together in your table. For more information, you can view the live example or review the source code to see how it's used with Chakra UI.
