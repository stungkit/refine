Access control refers to the methods and processes used to restrict access to certain parts of a web application or website based on the user's permissions. It ensures that users can only interact with the content and features they are authorized to use, enhancing security and user experience.

This example demonstrates how to use Refine and [Permify](https://permify.co/) to simplify access control management throughout your application.
