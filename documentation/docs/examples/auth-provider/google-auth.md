You can use Google Login to control access and provide identity for your app. This example will guide you through how to connect Google Login into your project using Refine.

:::note

If you are developing your own OAuth application, it's important to add the URLs of both your deployed application and your local development to the list of allowed origins in the OAuth app settings. Failure to do so can cause the app to fail.
